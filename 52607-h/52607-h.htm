<p class="hang">THE CONCLUSION OF THE DUCHESS OF
ORLEANS’ ADVOCATE AGAINST THE DUKE
OF BURGUNDY, AND THE REPLY FROM THE
CHANCELLOR.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> chancellor of France, in the king’s
name, ordered the duchess’s advocate, master
William Cousinot, to draw up such conclusions
as should be satisfactory to the duchess and her
son, the duke of Orleans. The advocate, after
many excuses, began by showing how pitiable
their state was, and took for his theme part of
the 7th chapter of the gospel of St Luke,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">H&aelig;c vidua erat quam cum vidisset Dominus
misericordia motus est super eam.</span>’</p>

<p>‘Most noble prince, when our Lord
entered a city called Nain, he met the corpse
of a young man, which his friends were
carrying to the grave; and when he noticed
that the mother of the young man was a
widow, he was on this account moved with
compassion toward her, and restored her son
to life. I may most truly apply these words
to my lady of Orleans, for she is a widow who
bewails the death of her lord and husband, and
our lord will have compassion on her; for the
king is our lord, in respect of terrestrial
jurisdiction; and not only the king, but thou,
lord of Acquitaine, and all other princes of this
world having territorial powers, seeing my lady
of Orleans thus disconsolate, ought to feel
compassion for her, and give her aid and
support in procuring strict justice to be done
for the cruel death of her husband.</p>

<p>‘In every case, and at all times, full
justice should be administered to all; for,
according to the words of the Psalmist, it is
a good and meritorious act,&mdash;‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Beati qui
custodiunt judicium et faciunt justitiam in
omni tempore.</span>’ Psalm cv.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>

<p>‘But justice should always be more
rigorously observed in regard to widows and
orphans, who have been deprived of their
fathers or husbands, than in any other case;
for the divine, canon and civil laws urge the
necessity of succouring the widow and orphan.
We have the first instance of this in the 22d
chapter of Jeremiah,&mdash;‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Facite judicium et
justitiam, et liberate vi oppressum de manu
calumniatoris, pupillum et viduam,</span>’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>‘In regard to the canon law, the decrees
declare, that it is very proper for kings to do
justice and execute judgment, and deliver from
the hands of the oppressors widows and orphans
who are injuriously used by them.</p>

<p>‘As for the civil law, it is very clear, that
widows and orphans are particularly privileged
in many cases, as may be seen in different law
writings.</p>

<p>‘My lady of Orleans has lost her
husband: her children have lost their father,
certainly one of the handsomest and most
accomplished princes in Christendom. But
let us see how they have lost him: had he
been taken from them by a natural death,
their case would not have been so much to be
pitied; but he is cut off violently in the flower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
of his youth. In truth, this is such an outrage
that every law and customary proceeding should
bend in their favour against the malignant author
of the deed.</p>

<p>‘In the first place, our king and sovereign
lord is bounden particularly by the commands
of God, to whom he cannot be disobedient
without sinning, to execute judgment, according
to the words of Jeremiah in the chapter before
mentioned,&mdash;‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In memetipso juravi, dicit
Dominus, quia in solitudine erit domus vestra.</span>’
And this is conformable to the reply made by
St Remy to king Clovis when he baptised him.
The king asked him how long the kingdom
of France would endure. The saint answered,
that it would last so long as justice should
reign there. The converse of which is, that
when justice shall cease to be administered, the
kingdom will fall. To the king therefore may
be applied what is written in the canon law,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod justitia est illud quod suum firmat
imperium.</span>’</p>

<p>‘O, duke of Acquitaine! thou art he
who, after the king, art bound to do justice
according to the words of the Psalmist, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus
judicium tuum regi da et justitiam tuam filio
regis.</span>’ Thou art the eldest son to the king, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
whom, by the grace of God, thou wilt succeed,
and be our lord: attend to our case for the love
of God, for to thee more particularly does it
belong; and if thou dost not lay thy hand on
it, when thou shalt come to reign, thou mayest
find thy kingdom desolate and destroyed,&mdash;for
each will in his turn seize parts of it, and be
the master, should this atrocious crime remain
unpunished.</p>

<p>‘Ye also, my lords, princes, dukes and
counts of the royal blood, relations of the late
duke, and ye other nobles, who have an
affection for the king’s crown and honour,
what ought to be your conduct on this
occasion? Why, certainly, if the king will not
interfere in this matter, ye ought to take up
the business and execute judgment; for ye are
bound by oath to guard and defend the king’s
honour against all who may infringe upon it.
This ye have done in former times, through
God’s grace, and for which this kingdom has
gained greater glory than any other realm in
Christendom: insomuch that the English, the
Germans, and other foreigners, have come
hither to seek for justice.</p>

<p>‘My lords, for the love of God, let your
loyalty burst forth, according to your oaths, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
behalf of my lady of Orleans, as she has the
fullest confidence it will; for, after God and
the king, you are her only refuge. Let no one
fear to do justice, from the scandal or persecution
that may ensue, for it is a maxim of law,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Utilius est scandalum nasci ac permitti, quam
ut veritas relinquatur,</span>’&mdash;although it were
certain the doing justice in this case would
cause much grievous persecution to ensue.
Yet for all this justice should not be neglected;
for in that case you would be indeed
reproachable, if, through fear of the offender,
you shall not dare to decree justice. On no
occasion should justice be neglected: therefore,
my lords, act according to what the prophet
says, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viriliter agite, et confortetur cor
vestrum et sustinete Dominum.</span>’</p>

<p>‘In truth, if ye do not act with courage,
for one inconvenience that may happen, by
executing judgment, one hundred would ensue
from default of justice. Therefore, my lords,
do not hesitate to do justice to my lady of
Orleans and her children from any dread of
inconveniences that may happen, but follow
the dictates of our Lord,&mdash;‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicare pupillo
et humili ut non apponat magnificare se homo
super terram.</span>’ Let the punishment be so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
exemplary that none other may henceforth
commit so great or so disgraceful a crime, and
that it may be held in perpetual memory and
abhorrence. This is the object of my lady of
Orleans and her children, namely, that the
crime may be atoned for as heavily as possible
in this world. In order that this atonement
may be made, my lady of Orleans and her
children would willingly take the legal steps
for the infliction of capital punishment, if this
could regularly be done; but as these steps,
according to the customary usage of France,
belong to the king’s attorney-general alone,
they propose that the offender shall be
punished in manner following,&mdash;that is to say,
by sentence of the king and of the court, be it
ordered that our adversary, the duke of
Burgundy, be brought to the castle of the
Louvre, or elsewhere, according to the king’s
pleasure and that of my clients, and there, in
the presence of the king, of my lord of
Acquitaine, and the other princes of the blood,
as well as of the council and people, the duke
of Burgundy, without hood or girdle, shall,
on his knees, publicly confess, with a loud
voice, before my lady of Orleans, her children,
and as many other persons as she may please,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
that maliciously and treacherously he has had
my lord of Orleans assassinated, through
hatred, envy and ambition, and for no other
cause, notwithstanding all the charges made
against him, and other imputations thrown on
his character, to justify and exculpate himself
from so base a deed; and shall demand pardon
from my lady of Orleans and her children,
most humbly supplicating them to forgive his
offences, declaring that he knows of nothing
prejudicial to the honour and reputation of the
said duke of Orleans deceased, and recals all he
may have said or published to the contrary.</p>

<p>‘In this state he shall be carried to the
court of the palace, and to the h&ocirc;tel de Saint
Pol, the residence of the king, and to the spot
where the murder was committed, and there,
on high stages erected for the purpose, he
shall repeat the above words before such
commissioners as my lady of Orleans and her
son may please to appoint. He shall remain
on his knees, at the last place, until priests
nominated for the purpose shall have recited
the seven penitential psalms, said the litany,
and the other parts of the burial service, for
the soul of the deceased, after which he shall
kiss the earth, and ask pardon of God, of my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
lady of Orleans, and of her children, for the
offences he has committed against them.</p>

<p>‘The manner and form of this recantation,
and begging pardon, shall be written out, and
copies sent to all the different towns in the
kingdom with orders for the magistrates to
have them proclaimed by sound of trumpet,
that it may be notorious to all within and
without the realm.</p>

<p>‘And as additional reparations for such
offences, and that they may remain in perpetual
remembrance, all the houses belonging to the
duke of Burgundy in Paris shall be razed to
the ground, and remain in ruins for ever. On
the places where any of his houses shall have
stood, there shall be erected handsome crosses
of stone, having large and strong tablets, on
which shall be written a full account of the
murder of my late lord, the duke of Orleans,
and the cause of these houses being destroyed.</p>

<p>‘On the spot where my late lord was
murdered shall be erected a similar cross; and
the house wherein the murderers hid themselves
shall be pulled down. This spot, and the
adjoining houses, the duke of Burgundy shall
be forced to purchase, and to build thereon a
handsome college for six canons, six vicars, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
six chaplains, whose nominations shall remain
with my lady of Orleans and her heirs. In
this college six masses shall be said every day
for the soul of the deceased duke of Orleans,
and high mass at the usual time of canonical
hours. For the support of this college there
shall be a mortmain rent of one thousand livres
parisis; and the whole shall be well furnished
with dresses, books, chalices, ornaments, and
all other necessaries, at the sole expense of the
duke of Burgundy; and over the entrance
shall be written in large letters the cause of its
foundation.</p>

<p>‘The duke of Burgundy shall, beside, be
constrained to found a college for the salvation
of the soul of the deceased, in the town of
Orleans, consisting of twelve canons, twelve
vicars, and twelve clerks, which college shall
bear the name of the defunct; and the
nominations to it shall belong to my lady of
Orleans, and to the heirs of the late duke of
Orleans. It shall be situated in whatever part
of the late duke’s possessions in Orleans the
duchess shall please, and shall be handsomely
constructed, furnished with books and all other
necessaries, with an income of two thousand
livres parisis; and a similar inscription to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
one before mentioned shall be placed over the
gate.</p>

<p>‘For the greater perpetuity of this event,
and that it may be made known to all foreign
nations, the duke of Burgundy shall be enjoined
to erect two chapels; the one near the holy
sepulchre at Jerusalem, and the other at Rome,
and assign to each the annual value of one
hundred livres in the coin of those countries,
and to provide them with all necessary furniture.
In each of these chapels shall a daily mass be
said for the soul of the deceased, and over the
doors shall be placed the same inscriptions as
over the colleges.</p>

<p>‘The duke of Burgundy shall also be
constrained to pay the sum of one million in
gold, not to the profit of my lady of Orleans
or her children, but to found and endow
hospitals and monasteries, and to distribute in
alms and other works of piety for the salvation
of the soul of the defunct.</p>

<p>‘That this sentence may be carried into
due effect, all the lands which the duke of
Burgundy possesses in this kingdom shall be
placed in the hands of the king, that they
may be sold for the accomplishment of the
above works. The duke of Burgundy shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
also be condemned to close imprisonment in
whatever place it may please the king, until
the above sentence be carried into execution.
After which, he shall be banished for ever
beyond sea, or at least for the space of twenty
years, to bewail and repent of his crime, or
until it shall be thought he may have sufficiently
done it. On his return, he shall be ordered,
under severe penalties, never to approach
within one hundred leagues of the queen or
the children of the late duke of Orleans,
without being condemned to such heavy
damages, and other penalties suited to the
enormity of the case, as shall be held in
perpetual remembrance. He shall also be
condemned to pay whatever costs my lady of
Orleans and her children may have occurred
on this present occasion.</p>

<p>‘I say, therefore, that such ought to be
the judgment given for them, and without
delay, considering the notoriety and enormity
of the offence of our adversary; for it is
publicly known, that the duke of Burgundy
has confessed himself guilty of it. He first
made a confession of his guilt to my lord of
Berry and to the king of Sicily, giving no
reason for it but that he was urged on by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
devil: he then did the same before several
noblemen. This ought therefore to weigh
against him, and convict him of the crime,
without further trial: nor ought you to suffer
any sort of colouring to be admitted in palliation
of his guilt. He ought not to be heard otherwise
than he has been, for he varied not in his
confessions to the different persons; and pope
Innocent approves of this, in his chapter on
Free Will, and Guillermus de Montleon, in
his chapter on Clerical Constitutions. Pope
Nicholas held king Lothaire, in like manner,
convicted to his prejudice in a certain case,
about which he had written to the pope, as
appears in the above chapter. This confession
of king Lothaire had been made in a letter,
previously to any trial. The duke of Burgundy,
therefore, ought to be condemned from this
public confession of his crime in the presence
of different persons. He has beside made a
similar confession when he appeared publicly
before thee, lord of Acquitaine, when thou
didst sit in judgment representing the person
of the king, and before the princes of the
blood and all the council of state. He cannot,
therefore, deny his having made such confession
before competent judges. It follows then, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
no further trial is necessary, but that sentence
should immediately be passed; for confession
of guilt should be judged the fullest evidence.</p>

<p>‘The law says, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In confitentem null&aelig;
sunt partes judicantis.</span>’ And supposing, that
according to some, a sentence is requisite, at
least it is certain that no trial or examination
of the cause is necessary, since this present
case is extremely notorious. So has it formerly
been determined by the sentence and judgment
of the kings in times past, against several great
lords of their day,&mdash;to wit, that when the facts
were notorious, no other process or inquisition
was required. And so shall it be determined,
by the grace of God, in the present case,&mdash;for
so reason demands.</p>

<p>‘Should it, however, be thought necessary
to go into another trial, which, from all I have
said, I cannot suppose, my lady of Orleans is
ready prepared to bring forward the fullest proof
of what I have advanced, and such as must
convince all reasonable persons. But as my
lady can now only offer civil conclusions, and
would willingly propose criminal ones, but
that it belongs to the king’s attorney-general
according to the usage in France,&mdash;my lady,
therefore, most earnestly supplicates the king’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
attorney to join with her, and propose such
sentence as the law in this case requires.’</p>

<p>These were the conclusions of my lady of
Orleans and her sons,&mdash;after which, the council
of the princes of the blood, and others of the
king’s council, with the approbation of the
duke of Acquitaine, made the chancellor reply
to the duchess of Orleans, that the duke of
Acquitaine, as lieutenant for the king, and
representing his person, and the princes of
the blood-royal were well satisfied with her
conduct respecting her late lord the duke of
Orleans: that they held him perfectly
exculpated from all the charges that had
been brought against him; and that, in regard
to her requests, speedy and good justice should
be done her, so that she should be reasonably
contented therewith.</p>

<p>A few days after, the young duke of
Orleans, Charles, did homage for the duchy
of Orleans, and all his other possessions, to his
uncle Charles king of France: then, taking
leave of the queen and dauphin, and the
princes of the blood who were in Paris, he
departed with his men at arms for Blois,
whence he had come. The duchess-dowager
of Orleans remained in Paris.

<p class="hang">GUYE DE ROVE, ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS,
APPEALS FROM THE CONSTITUTIONS DRAWN
UP BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS, WHICH
ANGERS THAT BODY, AND THEY IMPRISON
HIS COMMISSARY.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">At</span> this period, Guy de Roye<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>, archbishop
of Rheims, who had been summoned specially
by the king to attend the meeting of the prelates
at Paris, assembled to consider on the means of
uniting the whole church, neither came himself
nor sent any one in his behalf. He refused to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
agree to the decisions of this council, and sent
a chaplain as his commissary, with letters signed
with his name and seal, to confirm his opposition
to all the statutes they had drawn up, as well for
himself and his diocese as for all his subjects
within the province.</p>

<p>The king and the clergy were much
displeased at this conduct; and the university
of Paris requested that the commissary should
be confined in close imprisonment, where he
remained for a long time.</p>

<p>The cardinal of Bordeaux came at this
time to Paris, partly for the union of the
church; and then also returned thither master
Peter Paoul, and the patriarch of Alexandria,
named master Symon Cramant, who had been
sent by the king of France and the university
of Paris, as ambassadors to the two rival
popes.</p>

<p>The assembled prelates were very anxious
for their arrival, that they might be better
acquainted with the business they had to
manage, and on what grounds they should
proceed. Master Peter Paoul frequently rode
through the streets of Paris in his doctor’s
dress, accompanied by the cardinal riding on
one side of his horse as women do. In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
presence of this cardinal and doctor, the abbot
of Caudebec, of the order of Cistercians, and
doctor in theology, proposed, on the part of
the university, an union of the church. The
abbot of St Denis, with other doctors in
theology, declared for an union of the universal
church; and, shortly after, the cardinal departed
from Paris for Boulogne, and thence went to
Calais.</p>

<p>The abbot of St Denis and another doctor
of theology, who had been, by the king’s
orders, confined in the prison of the Louvre,
were released, at the request of the cardinal de
Bar, and set at liberty, contrary to the will of
the university of Paris. In like manner did
the bishop of Cambray, master Peter d’Ailly,
an excellent doctor of theology, gain his liberty.
He had been confined at the instance of the
university, because he was not favourable to
their sentiments, and was delivered at the
entreaties of count Waleran de St Pol, and the
great council of the king. All Christendom
was now divided in religious opinions, as to
the head of the church, by the contentions of
the two rival popes, who could not be brought
to agree on the means to put an end to this
disgraceful schism.

<p class="hang">THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE
BODY OF MEN AT ARMS TO SUCCOUR JOHN
OF BAVARIA AGAINST THE LIEGEOIS, AND
COMBATS THEM.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">About</span> this time, John duke of Burgundy
was busily employed in collecting a body of
men at arms to aid his brother-in-law, the
bishop of Liege, whom, as has been said, the
Liegeois had driven out of their country, and
besieged in the town of Maestricht. He sent
for succour among his friends and allies,
namely, to Burgundy, Flanders, Artois, and
the borders of Picardy, whence came very
many, and several from Savoy.</p>

<p>The earl of Mar, also, a Scotsman, then
at Bruges, with about four score combatants,
ready to embark for Scotland, advanced into
the Tournesis, whither the duke came, and
had a conference with their principal captains
in the town of Tournay.</p>

<p>On the eleventh day of September, he
marched thence with a numerous body of men
at arms, and a great train of artillery and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
baggage-waggons to Enghien, where he was
gladly received by the lord of the place. On
the morrow, he advanced to Nivelle in Brabant,
within a league of Salmes. He marched next
to Flourines, where he met sir Richard<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
Daulphin, sir William de Tignonville, lately
provost of Paris, and master William Bouratier,
one of the king’s secretaries, ambassadors to
him from the king of France. Having
obtained an audience, they said they had been
sent to him from the king and the great council
on two objects; first, to know whether the
Liegeois and their bishop were willing to
submit their differences to the king and the
great council; secondly, to inform him of the
suit urged against him by the duchess-dowager
of Orleans and her children, for the death of
the late duke of Orleans, his brother, of the
replies they had made to the charges he had
brought against the late duke, and that they
demanded instant justice on him the duke of
Burgundy, and that neither law nor reason
ought to prevent sentence being passed by the
king according to the conclusions that had
been drawn up against him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy shortly answered,
that in regard to the first point, he was willing,
as was right for him to do, to obey the king’s
orders, but that his brother-in-law, John of
Bavaria, who had married his sister, had most
earnestly solicited his assistance against the
commonalty and his subjects of Liege, who
had rebelled, and even held him besieged.
Similar requests had been made to duke
William, count of Hainault, his brother in
law, and also brother-in-law to John of
Bavaria: wherefore the armaments could not
now be broken up, since during the time the
ambassadors would be negotiating between the
two parties, John of Bavaria, their bishop and
lord, might be in great danger from his
rebellious subjects, and their success might
serve for an example and inducement for
other subjects to resist their lords, and give
rise to an universal rebellion. He added, that
the king and his council might, without any
prejudice to themselves, have refrained from
so readily listening to such requests, as none
of the aforesaid parties were subjects to the
kingdom of France.</p>

<p>In regard to the second point, he, John
duke of Burgundy, made answer, that instantly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
on his return from this expedition he would
wait on the king of France, and act towards
him, and all others, in a manner becoming a
good subject, and the near relationship in which
he stood to the king.</p>

<p>The ambassadors, finding they could not
obtain more satisfactory answers to the points
on which they were sent, were obliged to be
contented. They resolved, however, to wait
the event of this expedition against the Liegeois;
and during that time there came to the duke of
Burgundy, from the country of Hainault, his
brother-in-law duke William, accompanied by
the counts de Conversan, de Namur, and de
Salines, in Ardennes, with many notable lords,
as well knights as esquires, from Hainault,
Holland, Zealand, Ostrevant, and other places,
to the number of twelve hundred helmets<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>, or
thereabout, and two thousand infantry well
equipped, with from five to six hundred
carriages laden with provision and military
stores.</p>

<p>Many councils were held at Flourines,
and in that neighbourhood, as to their future
conduct, and whither they might march their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
army with the greatest probability of success.
It was determined that duke William should
command the van, and, as he advanced,
destroy the whole country with fire and sword;
that the duke of Burgundy, with the earl of
Mar and the main body, should direct their
march along the causeway of Branchaut, which
leads strait to Tongres and Maestricht. In the
last place, the lord de Pier-Yves<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> and the
Liegeois had, as has been before said, besieged
their bishop and lord, John of Bavaria.</p>

<p>In consequence of this resolution, the two
dukes began their march by different roads,
and destroyed all the country on the Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday, and met on the
Saturday evening, about vespers, in the town
of Montenach, situated on the above causeway.
In this place and neighbourhood was the whole
army lodged, forming but one body; and two
marshals were appointed to command and find
quarters for it;&mdash;on the part of the duke of
Burgundy, the lord de Vergy<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>,&mdash;and on that
of duke William, the lord de Jeumont. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
had under their immediate orders five hundred
helmets, seven hundred cross-bows, and fifteen
hundred archers, all men of tried courage, with
sixteen hundred carriages, as well carts as
waggons, laden with arms, ammunition and
provision, and all other necessaries for such an
expedition.</p>

<p>On this Saturday, the lord de Pier-Yves,
and his son the newly-elected bishop of Liege,
as they were besieging Maestricht, learnt from
their spies, that the two before-mentioned
dukes were rapidly advancing against them,
and burning the country on their line of
march. They instantly raised the siege, and
retreated to the city of Liege with full forty
thousand combatants, where they fixed their
quarters, Liege being only five leagues distant
from Maestricht. The commanders there
held a council, with such of the inhabitants as
had not been at the siege; and at its close it
was proclaimed through different parts of the
town, by orders of the governor and his son,
the bishop, that every man capable of bearing
arms should, on the morrow-morning, at the
sound of a bell, be ready equipped to follow
their commanders out of the town whithersoever
they might lead them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>In consequence of this order, on the
morrow, the 22d day of September 1408, there
issued out of Liege, according to computation,
about fifty thousand armed men. In this
number were from five to six hundred well
armed, in the french manner, on horseback,
and from one hundred to six score english
archers, in their pay. They were followed by
infinite numbers of carts and other carriages,
and a mob of people dressed in various manners,
according to their own fancies.</p>

<p>The bell tolled at break of day, and they
then sallied forth in good array, following their
governor and bishop, very eager to offer combat
to the enemy. Their governor had frequently
warned them of the dangers that might ensue
from a battle, as their enemies were, for the
greater part, nobles or gentlemen accustomed
to war and obedience to their commanders,
which was not the case with them; and that
it would be more to their advantage to remain
within well-inclosed towns and castles harrassing
the enemy by various means, and so tiring him
out that he should be forced to quit their
country.</p>

<p>This advice, however, was not agreeable
to the Liegeois, for it seemed to them that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
their numbers were so great that the enemy
could not resist them; and they were not well
pleased with what their governor had told
them. The governor, perceiving the Liegeois
determined on battle, led them into the plain,
and drew them up in handsome array. He
frequently exhorted them to behave themselves
valiantly, and with one accord, this day against
the enemy, who was marching to attack them,
and to defend with courage their lives and
liberties.</p>

<p>They marched near to Tongres, which is
five leagues distant from Liege, whither the
two dukes had advanced on the Saturday; for
they had already heard the siege of Maestricht
was broken up, and that the men of Liege
were intending to offer them battle. After
some councils had been holden with the
captains and the most experienced in their
army, they sent off, very early on the Sunday
morning, two hundred light troops, under the
command of Robert le Roux and some other
noblemen of the country, to inquire into the
truth of what they had heard, and to see what
the enemy was about. They shortly returned,
and told the dukes, that the intelligence they
had received was true, for that they had seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the Liegeois in great numbers marching in
battle-array. The dukes, on hearing this,
commanded their men to arm, and to draw
up in order of battle. When this was done,
they marched to meet the Liegeois, and
scarcely had they advanced half a league when
they appeared in sight.</p>

<p>The Liegeois also saw them, for they were
near to Tongres. Both armies advancing, the
dukes then posted themselves and all their
infantry on a very advantageous spot; and
thinking the enemy would attempt to dislodge
them, they formed their army into one battalion,
the better to support the attack, and placed
their baggage in their rear. They posted the
greater part of their archers and cross-bows on
their right and left as wings. The lord de
Miraumont this day commanded the archers,
by orders of the duke of Burgundy, and with
great credit to himself. The duke of Burgundy
was on the right, and duke William on the left
of the army, each attended by his own people.</p>

<p>After the proper orders had been given,
and every arrangement made according to the
advice of the most experienced officers, very
many new knights were created. The men of
Liege, swelled with pride, and arrogantly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
considering the army of their opponents as
infinitely inferior to them, marched on the
right for an eminence called the heights of
Hasbane, where they halted in handsome
array. They had with them the standard of
St Lambert, and those of their different guilds;
and the reason why they had halted on this
spot was, that some of their old men had told
them that it was there their ancestors had
gained a victory, and they flattered themselves
with similar success.</p>

<p>They then formed their army in handsome
order, and played off many cannons against
their enemies, which annoyed them very much.
It should be known, that between the two
armies was a narrow valley, at the bottom of
which was a ditch to carry off the water in
times of rain.</p>

<p>The two dukes having with their army
remained stationary, observing that the Liegeois
did not seem inclined to quit their position, and
begin the battle, held a short council with their
ablest officers, and thinking success was more
likely to follow the most courageous, determined
to advance slowly toward them in battle-array,
on account of the weight of their arms, and
attack them where they were, before they could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
fortify themselves, or increase their numbers
by reinforcements.</p>

<p>In consequence, five hundred men at arms,
on horseback, were ordered to attack the army
of Liege on its rear, and about a thousand
infantry, under the command of the lords de
Croy, de Helly, de Neufville and de Raise,
knights, with Enguerrand de Bournouville,
esquire, on the part of the duke of Burgundy;
and by the lords de Hamette and de Ligne,
knights, with Robert le Roux, esquire, who
instantly advanced into the plain according to
their orders.</p>

<p>The Liegeois, observing so large a
detachment quit the duke’s army, and march
away, as it were, thought they were running
off from fear of their great numbers, and
began shouting, in their language, ‘Fuyo,
fuyo!’ and repeating this word many times.
The lord de Pier-Yves, the governor, like an
able man, well versed in war, frequently, but
gently, checked them for making this noise,
saying, ‘My very dear friends, that troop on
horseback which you see, are not running away,
as you suppose; but when that other body of
infantry, much greater, as you may observe,
shall be advanced near enough to begin the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
attack, those on horseback will instantly wheel
about, like skilful soldiers, and charge your
rear, with a design to divide your army,
while the others shall attack you in front.
Notwithstanding we have every appearance
of a successful issue to our battle, I have
always advised you to the contrary; and
though your hearts are set upon it, as if
already sure of victory, I remain still in the
same opinion,&mdash;because you are not so well
used to warfare, nor armed like to your
adversaries, who have learnt all military
exercises from their childhood. This was
the reason why I proposed avoiding a battle;
for it would have been more to your advantage
to have defended your towns and fortresses, and
whenever a favourable opportunity offered, to
have fallen on your enemies, so that they would
have been forced to have quitted your country.
However, the day you have so ardently wished
for is now come; and I beg of you to put your
hopes in God, and boldly and steadily exert
yourselves in the defence of your country against
the enemy now marching to attack you.’</p>

<p>Having finished this speech, he wanted to
mount some of his most determined men on
horseback to oppose the detachment then on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
the plain; but in truth the commonalty would
not suffer it to be done, and uttered against him
many reproaches, calling him a traitor.</p>

<p>He patiently suffered their rude ignorance,
and hastily commanded the army to be formed
into a square, in the front of which was a body
drawn up in the form of a triangle,&mdash;and the
carts and baggage were towards the rear, on
the right and left of his army, handsomely
arranged: their horses were in the rear, on
one of the wings, intermixed with their archers
and cross-bows,&mdash;but they were of little value,
except the english archers, who were better
disposed of in other places.</p>

<p>The lord de Pier-Yves, accompanied by
his son the bishop and some of his best
companions in arms, like a good commander,
posted himself at the head of his army, fronting
the enemy.</p>

<p>During this time, the two dukes began
their march, gaily exhorting their men to
behave themselves gallantly against the enemy,
a rude and ignorant people, who had rebelled
against their lord, and who confidently trusted
in their superior numbers for success,&mdash;telling
their men, that if they acted as they expected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
they would, victory would infallibly be theirs,
and they would gain everlasting honour.</p>

<p>When the dukes had made such like
speeches, they retired to their posts, and under
their banners, and advanced slowly toward the
enemy, who kept up a heavy fire against them
with their cannons.</p>

<p>The banner-bearer of the duke of
Burgundy was a very valiant knight, called
sir James de Courtjambe, who, accidentally
falling on his knees as he marched, alarmed
many, who thought it was an unfavourable
omen of their success; but he was soon raised
by the help of those of his guard, and behaved
himself honourably the whole day. This knight
was a native of Burgundy. The banner of duke
William was that day borne by a gallant knight,
called sir Hoste d’Escaussines, who behaved
himself right well.</p>

<p>When the two armies met, the conflict
became very severe on each side, and lasted
for upwards of an hour, when many deadly
blows were given by both parties. At this
moment, the detachment on horseback, with
the infantry, according to their orders, advanced
to the rear of the Liegeois; but from the position
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
of their baggage-waggons, they had much
difficulty to force their way. At length, by
dint of courage, they succeeded, and, having
gained an entrance, began to lay about them
so vigorously that the army of the enemy
was divided,&mdash;and they saw full six thousand
Liegeois quit their ranks, with their guns and
the banners of their guilds, and take flight with
all speed towards a village half a league from
the field of battle.</p>

<p>When the detachment perceived this, they
left off the attack they had begun, and pursued
the runaways, whom they charged, not once,
but several times, beating down and slaying
them without mercy,&mdash;and, in short, routed
them so effectually that, through fear of death,
they fled here and there, into woods and other
places, to hide themselves.</p>

<p>This party of the Liegeois being either
killed, dispersed, or taken prisoners, the
horsemen returned to their main body,
gallantly fighting the enemy, who, it must
be said, defended themselves courageously.
In truth, the event of this battle was some
time doubtful,&mdash;for, during one half hour, it
could not be known which side would be
victorious. The noise of their war-cries was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
frightful:&mdash;the Burgundians and Hainaulters
shouted under their banners, ‘Our Lady for
Burgundy! Our Lady for Hainault!’ and the
Liegeois, in their turn, shouted, ‘St Lambert
for Pier-Yves!’</p>

<p>The men of Liege would perhaps have
conquered, if this detachment on horseback,
when returned from the defeat of the runaways,
had not again fallen on their rear, and behaved
so marvellously well that those who opposed
them were pierced through, and all attempts
to check them were vain. A great slaughter
was made by them in a short time, for none
were admitted to ransom; and by their vigour
whole ranks fell one over the other, for now
all the weight and power of the infantry were
brought against them.</p>

<p>The defeat once begun, there were such
heaps of dead and wounded that it was
melancholy to behold, for they were thicker
in many places than stooks of corn in harvest.
This ought not to occasion surprise; for when
the common people are assembled, badly armed,
and puffed up with their extravagant desires,
although they be in great numbers, yet shall
they hardly be able to resist an army composed
of noblemen well tried in arms, even when God
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
shall permit it so to be. At this period of the
battle, and near to the banner of the duke of
Burgundy, where the conflict was the strongest,
fell the lord de Pierre-Yves and his two sons,&mdash;namely,
the one who had been elected bishop
of Liege and his brother: they were instantly
put to death.</p>

<p>The heir of Salmes<a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>, who bore the
standard of St Lambert, namely, the eldest
son to the count de Salmes<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>, who was in the
army of the two dukes; sir John Collet, and
many other knights and esquires to the amount
of upwards of five hundred; all the english
archers, and about twenty-eight thousand of
the commonalty, were left dead on the field,&mdash;and
more perished by arrow-shots than by any
other weapon.</p>

<p>Sir Baldwin de Montgardin, knight, to
save his life, surrendered himself to the duke
of Burgundy:&mdash;he was led out of the
engagement, and afterward given by the
duke to sir Wicart de Bours.</p>

<p>I have no need to particularise the great
courage and coolness of the duke of Burgundy,
nor how he galloped to different parts of the
army, exhorting them to act well,&mdash;nor how,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
until the end of the battle, he most gallantly
behaved himself,&mdash;for in truth, his conduct
was such that he was praised and spoken of
by all knights and others; and although he
was frequently covered with arrows and other
missile weapons, he did not on that day lose
one drop of blood.</p>

<p>When he was asked after the defeat, if
they should cease from slaying the Liegeois,
he replied, ‘Let them all die together! for
I will not that any prisoners be made, nor that
any be ransomed!!’</p>

<p>In the like gallant manner did duke
William, the other princes, and in general the
whole body of the chivalry and nobility of the
two dukes behave themselves. There were
slain from five to six hundred of their men;
and among the number were, John de la
Chapelle, knight to the above duke,&mdash;sir
Flourimont de Brimeu, John de la Trimouille,
who on this day had been made a knight,&mdash;Hugotin
de Nambon, John de Theune,
viscount de Brimequet, a native of Hainault,&mdash;Rollant
de la Mote, and others, to the amount
of one hundred and six score gentlemen: the
rest were varlets<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>Just as the dukes had gained the victory,
about two thousand men made a sally from
Tongres, to assist the Liegemen. When they
saw they were defeated, they retreated to their
town, but were so closely pursued by the body
of horse that had done such essential service
that very many of them were killed.</p>

<p>The two dukes, seeing their victory was
now complete, met, and returned thanks to
the Creator, congratulating with one another
for their success. They had tents pitched on
the field of battle, and remained there for three
days and three nights.</p>

<p>The french ambassadors, having now
taken their leave, departed for Tournay, and
continued their road to Paris to the king and
his council; but prior to their departure, the
duke of Burgundy had dispatched a messenger
to the king of France, with letters to inform
him and his good friends in Paris of the
fortunate event of the battle. This news was
not very agreeable to many who were intending
to urge the king to prosecute the duke of
Burgundy for the murder of the late duke of
Orleans,&mdash;and on the contrary, it gave great
joy to his friends.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>On Monday, the morrow of the battle,
about the hour of twelve, John of Bavaria,
bishop of Liege, attended by the heir of
Heinseberg, and several others, nobles and
not nobles, to the number of six hundred
helmets, or thereabout, came from the town of
Maestricht, wherein they had been besieged,
to the camp of the two dukes, and most
humbly thanked them for the succour they
had afforded him. He and his party were
received with much joy; and, on his arrival,
he was presented with the head of the lord de
Pier-Yves, which had been found among the
dead, with his two sons, and was fixed to the
top of a lance, that all who pleased might
see it!</p>

<p>On the following Tuesday, the feast of
St Fremin, a martyr, the inhabitants of Liege,
Huy, Dinant and Tongres, and of all the
other good towns in the bishoprick of Liege,
excepting the castle of Bouillon, hearing of
the great destruction of their countrymen, and
the power of their enemies, were panic-struck,
and, seeing no probability of any assistance,
surrendered themselves to the obedience of the
dukes of Burgundy and of Holland. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
sent to them ambassadors to this effect, and
also to supplicate John of Bavaria, their bishop
and lord, that he would graciously have pity
upon them, and grant them his pardon.</p>

<p>The bishop, through the intercession of
the two dukes, complied with their request,
on condition that such as had been most active
in promoting the rebellion, many of whom
were still alive, whose names they would set
down, should be given up to the two dukes,
to do by them as they in their justice should
think right; and each of the towns gave
sufficient hostages for the due performance of
the terms.</p>

<p>On the ensuing Thursday, the two
dukes and the bishop, with the whole army,
broke up the camp, and advanced toward the
town of Liege. The duke of Burgundy was
quartered in the town of Flauye, on the river
Meuse, one league distant from Liege, and
duke William among the mountains.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday, the dukes and
the bishop held a full council, to which all
their ministers were admitted, on the present
state of affairs. Other councils were continued
until the Tuesday, when the bishop made his
entry into Liege, and was received with great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
humility by the remnant of its inhabitants.
The most culpable in the late rebellion had
been before arrested and thrown into prison in
this and in all the other towns.</p>

<p>The bishop went first to the cathedral
church of St Lambert to offer his prayers, and
reconcile himself with the chapter: after this
he went to his palace, when he was most
humbly entreated by the people to have mercy
on them, which he granted; and, shortly after,
he returned to the camp of the two dukes.</p>

<p>About two o’clock in the afternoon, on
the morrow, the dukes and the bishop, with
several nobles of the army, assembled on an
elevated spot near the camp, whither sir John
de Jeumont, marshal to duke William, by the
commands of the two dukes and the bishop,
had ordered the heir of Rochefort, a rich
nobleman, John de Saramie<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, knight, and
fifteen other citizens, to be brought from the
town, and had their heads cut off, one after
another, by the executioner. Many churchmen,
and some women, were also drowned in the
Meuse for having been concerned in the
rebellion!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>On the morrow, the dukes and the bishop
moved with the army to a town three leagues
distant, called Beaucloquet, where many
conferences were held, on the state of the
country. The count de Nevers joined his
brother, the duke of Burgundy, at this place,
with four hundred combatants. Hither also
sir John de Jeumont ordered nineteen citizens
from the town of Huy to be brought, who
underwent a similar punishment to those of
Liege, and for the same cause; and, as before,
many churchmen and women were drowned<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>.</p>

<p>Am&eacute; de Viry, a Savoyard, a nobleman
well experienced in war, came hither also to
aid the duke of Burgundy, and accompanied
by three hundred helmets from that country.
When the dukes and the bishop had for several
days consulted together on the affairs of Liege,
it was at length concluded, with the approbation
of John of Bavaria, now surnamed John the
Pitiless, that they should all meet again in
the city of Tournay, on St Luke’s day next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
ensuing, to determine finally on the measures
to be pursued touching these matters.</p>

<p>After many executions had taken place
in the bishoprick of Liege on those who had
been concerned in the rebellion, and when the
fortifications of the towns of Huy, Dinant and
others, had been destroyed, the two dukes
began their march homeward, taking with
them a number of persons from Liege, who
had been given as hostages for the observance
of all the articles of the treaty that should be
made with them. Some of them were sent by
duke William to Mons and Valenciennes, and
some to Lille, Arras, and other places belonging
to the duke of Burgundy, who went to his
county of Flanders, and duke William to
Hainault, after they had disbanded their men
at arms. The greater part returned to their
homes much enriched by the plunder of the
Liegeois, who, thunderstruck by the misfortune
that had befallen them, became stupified and
indolent.</p>

<p>Many great lords attended the duke of
Burgundy on this expedition: among them
were, from Burgundy, sir John de Ch&acirc;lons<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
sir Gaultier de Ruples, the lord de Vergy<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>,
marshal of Burgundy, the lord de St George,
sir John de la Balme<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>, sir William de
Champ-divers, sir James de Courtjambe, the
lord de Montagu, and many more. From
Picardy, the lords de Croy<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>, de Heilly, de
Fosseux, de Vaurin, sir Bort Guieret and his
brothers, the lord of Inchy, the lord of Raisse,
the lord de Brimeu, sir Regnault de Crequy
lord of Comtes<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>, Enguerrand de Bournouville,
the lord de Ront, sir Raoul de Flandres, the
lord de Poix, sir Wincart de Bours, the lord
d’Auxy, the lord de Mailly, the lord de
Thiennes and the lord d’Azincourt. From
Flanders, sir John and sir Louis de Guystelle,
the lord de Hames, sir John de Bailleul, sir
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Collart de Fosseux, and others, the principal
nobles of the country.</p>

<p>In like manner, duke William had
assembled his nobles, with many others, his
allies; among whom was sir John de Bethune,
brother to the viscount de Meaux. Common
report said, that Anthony duke of Brabant,
brother to the duke of Burgundy, and Waleran
de Luxembourg count de St Pol, had refused
their assistance, because they had not been
made acquainted with the terms and agreements
entered into by John of Bavaria on the one
part, and the lord de Pier-Yves on the other,
for the resignation of the bishoprick of Liege.
They also made other excuses.</p>

<p>When the day appointed for the meeting
of the duke of Burgundy, duke William and
the bishop of Liege, in the town of Tournay,
for the final settlement of the affairs of Liege
drew near, the inhabitants of that town sent
them a petition, by ambassadors chosen from
among the principal citizens, to request they
would fix on some other town, as the numbers
of their attendants would greatly harrass and
impoverish them, considering the very small
stock of provision that was in Tournay.
Their request was granted,&mdash;and the town of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Lille was chosen for their meeting on the day
that had before been fixed on.</p>

<p>Thither all the hostages from Liege were
conducted, and brought into the presence of
the aforesaid dukes and bishop, with several
more that had been deputed to hear what
judgment should be given, which was as
follows:</p>

<p>‘The dukes of Burgundy and Holland
declare, that this their judgment shall be
punctually fulfilled in every respect, with
regard to the present time, reserving to
themselves the power of making any future
alterations in it as often as, and in what
manner, they shall please.</p>

<p>‘First, They consent that the inhabitants
of Liege, of the towns and country of that
bishoprick, situated within the district of
Liege, the country of Los, the countries of
Hasbane, St Tron, the territory of Bouillon,
shall enjoy their customary franchises and
privileges. They order, that the citizens of
Liege, and of the other towns above named,
do bring to the monastery des Escolliers, in
the town of Mons in Hainault, on the morrow
of Martinmas-day next ensuing, all the letters
patent and charters of their laws and privileges,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
which they possess,&mdash;which they will deliver
into the hands of such as may be commissioned
by the said dukes to receive them. Those who
bring them shall make oath, on the salvation
of their own souls, and of the souls of them
who sent them, that they have not fraudulently
left behind any charters of their laws and
privileges.</p>

<p>‘Item, the dukes aforesaid declare, that
should the city of Liege, or any other town,
neglect to send, or fraudulently retain, any of
their charters, that town so retaining them
shall be for ever deprived of its privileges and
particular laws.</p>

<p>‘Item, the lords aforesaid will, that these
charters and letters patent be delivered to the
commissioners punctually on the morrow of
Martinmas-day.</p>

<p>‘Item, they likewise ordain, that when
these charters and privileges shall have been
duly examined, and new ones drawn up and
delivered, neither the bishop of Liege nor his
chapter shall grant any new privileges to the
inhabitants, without the consent of the two
dukes or their successors.</p>

<p>‘Item, they also ordain, that henceforward
the commonalty shall not appoint or nominate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
in the aforesaid towns and bishoprick, any
officers, such as governors, masters of trades,
doctors of arts,&mdash;but that from this day all
such offices be annulled.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that all bailiffs,
provosts, mayors, and others bearing similar
titles, shall be nominated by the bishop of
Liege and the count de Los;&mdash;and also, that
the sheriffs in such towns as claim the right of
shrievalty shall be renewed yearly, and a certain
number appointed according to the exigency
of the case and size of the towns. In no large
town shall father and son, two brothers-in-law,
two cousins-german, the uncle and nephew, nor
anyone who has married the mother of another,
be appointed sheriffs at the same time, in order
that no improper favours be shewn from
partiality of kindred. All officers shall swear
solemnly on their creation, to preserve and
abide by every article and point contained in
the constitution delivered to them.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that the bishop of
Liege may, each year, at the expiration of the
shrievalty, appoint such sheriffs as he shall
please, or re-appoint those of the preceding
year, or others according to his good pleasure,
provided they are not any way connected by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
blood, as has been before mentioned. All
disputes respecting the persons or fortunes
of the inhabitants of the different towns
having sheriffs, shall be brought before their
jurisdictions,&mdash;and at the end of the year,
the sheriffs shall be bound to render an
account of their administration before their
lord, the bishop of Liege, or his deputies,
and before one commissary deputed by the
chapter, and another on the part of the
different churches.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that all guilds and
fraternities in the city of Liege, and in all the
other towns, shall henceforth cease and be
annulled; and that the banners of the above
guilds in Liege shall be delivered up to
commissaries, on an appointed day that shall
be made known to them; and the banners
of the other towns shall be brought by the
inhabitants to a certain place on an appointed
day, to the commissioners named to receive
them, and who shall do with them as they
may judge expedient.</p>

<p>‘Item, they also ordain, that in the above
city, and in the towns within the said bishoprick,
no one shall be reputed a citizen unless he shall
have really resided within such town in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
he shall claim his right of citizenship. And
all such rights of citizenship are for the present
annulled; for although there may be resident
citizens in the aforesaid towns, they cannot, in
such right, claim any moveables by reason of
inheritance, without the cognizance of the
lords under whom such persons have lived,
and in whose territory such inheritances are
situated.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that from this
moment, and in times to come, the towns of
Huy, Dinant, and others within the territory
of Liege, the country of Los, the country of
Hasbane, and all within the jurisdiction of
Liege, shall no longer call together any
assembly, or congregation of people, under
pretence of holding councils or otherwise,
without the consent of their aforesaid bishop
and lord, or of the chapter of Liege, should
the bishoprick at the time be vacant.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that the bishop of
Liege, or any others having the government
of the said territory and its dependancies, shall
never bear arms against the king or kings of
France, their successors; nor against the two
said dukes, their successors in the said duchies
and counties; nor against the count de Namur
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
for the time being, or his successors; nor against
any of the countries, of the aforesaid, except
when ordered by the emperor, and only when
the emperor shall be himself present: provided,
nevertheless, that the king of France and the
above-mentioned persons do not invade the
territories of the bishop and chapter of Liege.</p>

<p>‘Item, they likewise ordain, that in
perpetual remembrance of this victory, and
the conquest made over them by the above
two dukes, they and their successors shall have
a free passage, whenever they may choose to
cross the river Meuse, through all towns in the
territory of Liege, fortified or not, and with
a body of men at arms or with few attendants
according to their pleasure,&mdash;provided they do
not permit any of the inhabitants of the said
towns, villages, or country through which they
shall pass, to be any way molested by their
men,&mdash;and provisions shall be found them for
their money, without demanding higher prices
for the articles than they are usually sold for.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that the coin of the
aforesaid dukes and their successors shall have
free currency throughout the territories and
dependancies of the bishop and chapter of
Liege.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that a chapel shall
be erected on the spot where the last victory
was gained, and funds allotted for the support
of four chaplains and two priests; and the
said chapels shall be furnished with chasubles,
chalices, and other ornaments for celebrating
mass and such other divine services as shall be
thought advisable for the eternal welfare of the
souls of those who were slain in that battle.
The nomination to the above benefices shall
remain with the two dukes, according to
regulations which they shall hereafter make
between themselves,&mdash;the Liegeois only to be
once at the expense of providing this chapel
with sacred vessels and ornaments. The bishop
of Liege shall allot from his revenues two
hundred golden crowns of annual rent for the
support of the four chaplains and two priests;
that is to say, for each chaplain forty crowns,
for each priest ten crowns, and for the repairs
of the chapel twenty crowns.</p>

<p>‘Item, the said dukes will, that on the
twenty-third day of every month of September,
on which day the battle took place, a mass shall
be celebrated to the blessed Virgin, with great
solemnity, by the provost or dean of the church
of St Lambert, in Liege, who shall chaunt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
it in the choir and at the grand altar, in
commemoration of this victory, and for the
welfare of the souls of those who fell in
battle. The same shall be required of all the
churches and chapels to monasteries, as well
for men as women, within the said town of
Liege, as of all others within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>‘Item, the said dukes require from the
bishop of Liege and the chapter, that they
strictly enjoin such services to be regularly
performed on every twenty-third day of
September throughout the diocese; and that
all priests, after the performing of this service,
shall be suffered peaceably to return to their
homes.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that the bishop of
Liege and his successors, and such as may
have the government of the country in times
of a vacancy in the see, and the members of
the chapter of Liege, shall appoint such
governor of the castle of Huy as they shall
approve of: in which castle, likewise, they
shall not place a greater garrison, nor more
stores of provision, than they shall judge
expedient, like as an upright lord shall
determine. They also insist on having a free
ingress and regress into and from the town of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Huy and the adjacent country. They likewise
ordain the same regulations respecting the
castles of Escoquehen<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and Bouillon, as to
their governors, garrisons and stores.</p>

<p>‘Item, the aforesaid dukes ordain, that
should any one, however high his rank,
attempt, by force, or otherwise, to deprive
those of such gifts and preferments in the
church, or any other offices for life, as have
been usually granted by the bishops of Liege
and their predecessors, the members of the
chapter of Liege shall be bound to restore, and
defend them in, their possessions to the utmost
of their power, without any fraud whatever.</p>

<p>‘Item, as there are still living many
perverse conspirators, who are now fugitives
from the territories of Liege and county of
Los, and have retired into the neighbouring
countries, where they have been received,
the dukes aforesaid will appoint proper
commissioners to make inquiry whither such
wicked persons have gone, and publish their
names. On the discovery of the places to
which they have withdrawn, applications shall
be made to the princes and lords thereof, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
they may be surrendered to the bishop of
Liege, for him to inflict on them the
punishments due to their deserts, or at least
that such princes and lords may drive them
out of their respective countries. But should
these lords refuse to comply, or to do justice
on such conspirators, they shall be for ever
banished from the bishoprick of Liege, the
county of Los, and their dependancies, as
conspirators and movers of sedition; and it
shall be proclaimed throughout the above
countries, that no one receive them within
their houses, but deliver them up to justice,
should any attempt to return, demanding
assistance from their lord, should there be a
necessity for it. Should they be unable to
arrest them, they shall denounce them to the
nearest officers of justice, under pain of suffering
corporal punishment, and having their fortunes
confiscated, as would have been done to such
conspirators and rebels. While exerting
themselves in the performance of this duty,
should they accidentally put to death any of
such rebels, no consequences shall ensue to
their loss.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain that the walls of the
castle of Thuin, with its gates and towers, be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
razed, as well the part toward the town as that
toward the mountain, and the ditches filled up.</p>

<p>‘Item, the same to be done to the town
of Fosse and to the town and castle of
Commun,&mdash;which towns shall not be repaired.
And in like manner shall all the posts on the
river Sambre be destroyed, the ditches filled,
and neither they nor the towns shall be ever
again repaired, so that they may serve for
places of defence to the inhabitants, on any
pretence, in future times.</p>

<p>‘Item, the gates, walls and towers of
Dinant shall be pulled down, as well on the
opposite side of the Meuse as on this; and the
inhabitants shall never rebuild them again.</p>

<p>‘Item, the inhabitants of the said towns
of Thuin, Fosse, Commun and Dinant, or any
persons from other towns, shall not rebuild or
repair the fortified places between or on the
two rivers Sambre and Meuse, on the road to
Namur.</p>

<p>‘Item, one of the gates of Tongres shall
also be razed, namely, that which leads to
Maestricht, with forty feet of wall on each
side of the said gate, without a possibility of its
ever being re-erected. The town of Tongres
shall likewise, at its own expense, cause to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
filled up the trenches they had opened before
the said town, when they besieged their lord
within it, because they had put the country of
Liege under heavy taxes, and had subjugated it.</p>

<p>‘And whereas it is notorious, that very
great losses have attended this subjugation, the
aforesaid dukes will, that an aid be levied on
this city, and the towns before mentioned, to
the amount of two hundred and twenty
thousand golden crowns, which shall be raised
as soon as may be, being levied in proportion
to the comparative riches of each inhabitant.</p>

<p>‘Item, in case any of the hostages shall
die before all the articles of this treaty are
completed, the aforesaid lords will, that the
town or district whence such hostage or
hostages shall have been sent, do instantly
furnish others of the same rank and property
as those who have died.</p>

<p>‘Item, they ordain, that when this treaty
shall be properly engrossed, the bishop of Liege,
his chapter, and the principal inhabitants, shall
come to sign it, and engage, that should any
articles of it be not completed according to the
exact tenor of the terms, then for each omission
or neglect the bishop, his successors, the chapter
and chief towns shall forfeit two hundred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
thousand golden crowns of the coin of the
king of France, or other florins of gold of
France, of the value of the aforesaid crowns.
That is to say, fifty thousand to the then
emperor or king of the Romans; to the king
of France fifty thousand; and to each of the
said dukes the like sum;&mdash;the whole to be
levied on the lands and moveables of the said
Liegeois, by seizure of their goods and bodies
wherever they may be.</p>

<p>‘They are likewise to signify their consent,
that should obstacles be thrown in the way by
any of the said towns to prevent the articles of
the said treaty from being carried into effect,
the bishop of Liege, and the archbishop of
Cologne for the time being, shall be the
arbitrators between such towns,&mdash;and their
decision shall be final.</p>

<p>‘When a legal pope shall be elected, and
his authority over the whole church of God be
acknowledged, then such as make opposition
to the execution of the above treaty shall be
laid under an interdict, which shall not be
taken off, until sufficient reparation be made,
and the aforesaid pecuniary forfeitures be paid.</p>

<p>‘Should any of the towns, or their
inhabitants, offer any insult, in contradiction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
to the above treaty, to either of the said dukes
or their successors, the bishop of Liege, or his
vicar in his absence, the chapter and citizens
shall be required to constrain the offenders to
make full reparation within one month from
the time of complaint being made. And
should such reparation not be made within the
month, as aforesaid, after the summons to that
effect has been delivered, the country shall be
liable to the same fines as before mentioned.</p>

<p>‘The dukes of Burgundy and of Holland
order, that all these articles be fairly engrossed,
and then sealed with their seals, and then given
to the lord bishop of Liege, or to his chapter,
with a copy for the city of Liege and one for
each principal town. In return, the bishop
and the towns shall give to the dukes
aforesaid letters signed with their great seals
acknowledging the receipt of the above treaty,
and promising obedience to all the articles of
it, and binding themselves to the fines therein
mentioned.</p>

<p>‘As many noble persons and others, as
well secular as ecclesiastic, have presented
many petitions to complain of the great losses
they have suffered during the late rebellion,
and specifying their particular grievances,&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
dukes aforesaid, not having had time to
examine them with the attention they deserve,
will have them examined with all possible
speed, and will attend to each of them.’</p>

<p>The whole of the above, having been
written out fair, was, by the command of the
two dukes aforesaid, publicly proclaimed in
the great hall at Lille, and in their presence,
the 24th day of October, in the year 1408.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_IV">CHAP. IV.</h2>


<p class="hang">THE KING OF FRANCE HOLDS A GRAND
COUNCIL AT PARIS, TO CONSIDER ON THE
MANNER OF PROCEEDING AGAINST THE
DUKE OF BURGUNDY FOR THE MURDER OF
THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> the expedition of the duke of
Burgundy against the Liegeois, a great many
of the principal lords were, by the king’s
orders, assembled at Paris. Among them
were, Louis king of Sicily, Charles king of
Navarre, the duke of Brittany, the duke of
Bourbon, and several others, the greater part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
of whom were friendly to the duchess-dowager
of Orleans and her children in their prosecution
of the duke of Burgundy. Many councils
were held as to the manner in which the king
should proceed against the duke of Burgundy,
who was the principal actor in this murder, as
has been before explained.</p>

<p>It was at length determined in these
councils, that a most rigorous prosecution, in
conformity to the laws, should be carried on
against him; and should he refuse to obey, the
king, with all his subjects and vassals, should
march, with as great a force as could be raised,
against him, to bring him and his abettors to
due obedience.</p>

<p>At the same time, at the solicitations of
the duchess of Orleans and her children, the
king annulled all his letters of pardon which
he had formerly granted to the duke of
Burgundy, and declared them of no weight,
in the presence of the queen, the duke of
Acquitaine, the princes of the blood, and the
whole of the council. The duchess demanded
and obtained letters, confirming this renunciation
of the pardon; after which, she and her
daughter-in-law, wife to the young duke of
Orleans, left Paris, and returned to Blois.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>Not long after this, news came to Paris
of the great victory which the duke of
Burgundy had gained over the Liegeois.
This was confirmed by the return of the king’s
ambassadors, sir Guichard Daulphin and sir
William de Tignonville, who, as has been
related, were present at the battle, and gave to
the king and the lords then in Paris a most
circumstantial account of it. On hearing this,
several who had been most violent against the
duke of Burgundy, now hung their heads, and
began to be of a contrary opinion to what they
had before held, fearing the steadiness, boldness
and power of the duke, who was said to have
a mind equal to the support of any misfortunes
that should happen to him, and which would
encourage him to oppose and conquer all
attempts of his adversaries. In short, all the
measures that had been adopted against him
were dropped, and the men at arms were
ordered to return to the places whence they
had come.</p>

<p>Ambassadors had arrived from England
to treat of a peace, or a truce for one year,
between the kings of England and of France,
which having obtained, they set out on their
return, through Amiens and Boulogne, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Calais. On the road, they heard of the grand
victory of the duke of Burgundy, which
surprised them very much,&mdash;and they gave
him the surname of ‘Jean sans peur.’</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy was very active
in attaching to his party noblemen and
warriors from all countries, to strengthen
himself against his enemies, of whom he was
given to understand that he had many. He
held on this subject several consultations with
his two brothers and brothers-in-law, namely,
duke William of Holland and John of Bavaria,
to which were admitted his most trusty friends;
and they deliberated long on the manner in
which he should now carry himself. It was
at length finally concluded, that he should
openly oppose all, excepting the king of
France and the duke of Acquitaine; and
those present promised him aid and support
with all the power of their vassals, on these
terms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAP_V">CHAP. V.</h2>

<p class="hang">THE KING OF FRANCE IS CARRIED, BY THE
PRINCES OF THE BLOOD, TO TOURS IN
TOURAINE.&mdash;&mdash;PEACE IS MADE IN THE
TOWN OF CHARTRES.&mdash;THE DEATH OF THE
DOWAGER DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> king of France left Paris, accompanied
by the kings of Sicily and Navarre, the queen,
the duke of Acquitaine, the dukes of Berry and
Bourbon, who, with others of the blood-royal,
conducted him, under the escort of a large
body of men at arms, to Tours in Touraine,
as his place of residence,&mdash;to the great
displeasure of the inhabitants of Paris, who
were so much troubled thereat that they
barricadoed the streets with chains. They
hastily sent to inform the duke of Burgundy,
at Lille, of the king’s departure, giving him
to understand that the greater part of those
who had carried him away from Paris were
not well inclined towards him.</p>

<p>This intelligence was not very agreeable
to the duke, for he suspected that the king had
only been conducted to Tours that his enemies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
might carry their measures against him more
securely; for the lords who had the government
knew well that the Parisians loved the duke of
Burgundy, and would not that any other should
have the government of the kingdom, believing,
from the hints he had thrown out, that when in
power he would abolish all gabelles and other
taxes which oppressed the people.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy first consulted the
dukes of Brabant and of Holland, and other
steady friends, and then remanded his men at
arms from Burgundy, who were on their march
to their own country from Liege, and assembled
another body from various parts. He advanced
to Roye, in the Vermandois, where he mustered
his men, and then marched them toward Paris.
He quartered himself, on the 23d day of
November, in the town of St Denis, and his
forces in the adjacent country. On the morrow,
as he was advancing with his men at arms in
array toward Paris, two thousand or more
combatants sallied out thence, and conducted
him, with every mark of honour, to his h&ocirc;tel
of Artois.</p>

<p>Many of the Parisians sung carols in the
squares, although all rejoicings had been
strictly forbidden on his arrival, to avoid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
increasing the envy of the princes of the
blood. Some of the king’s servants said to
those who were singing carols, ‘You may
otherwise show your joy for his arrival, but
you ought not thus to sing.’ Notwithstanding
this, all the principal citizens, and those in
authority, showed him as much honour and
respect as if he had been king himself.</p>

<p>A few days afterward, duke William,
count of Hainault, arrived at Paris, well
accompanied by unarmed men, and, at the
request of the duke of Burgundy, set out for
Tours, attended by the lords de Croy, de
St George, de la Viefville, d’Olhaz, and others
of the council of the duke, to negotiate his
peace with the king, and the lords who had
carried him from Paris. The count of Hainault
was most honourably received at Tours by the
king, the queen, and the other great lords; for
the marriage had taken place between John
duke of Touraine, second son to the king,
and the daughter of the duke of Burgundy:
he was also nearly related to the queen.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the feasts made on
his arrival, the count of Hainault and those
who had accompanied him opened, in full
council, the business of their mission, namely,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
to make peace for the duke of Burgundy.
After many discussions, it was resolved, that
the king should send certain persons, selected
by him, to hold a conference with the duke of
Burgundy at Paris, and point out to him the
means of his regaining the good graces of the
king.</p>

<p>Duke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the
queen, Montagu grand master of the king’s
household, and other experienced counsellors,
were nominated for this purpose; and they
returned with the count de Hainault to Paris,
when what had passed was told to the duke of
Burgundy.</p>

<p>As all the circumstances of this treaty
were not agreeable to the duke, and as he had
many suspicions respecting Montagu, he was
not disposed to receive the negotiators in the
way they were sent to him. He even personally
made many reproaches to Montagu, who bore
them patiently, excusing himself for any thing
that had passed. The treaty, however, having
been altered and corrected, was sent back to
the king at Tours, and in the end agreed to in
the manner you shall hear.</p>

<p>While these negotiations were going
forward, and before their conclusion, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
duchess-dowager of Orleans, daughter to
Galeazzo duke of Milan, died in the town
of Blois, broken-hearted at not having been
able to obtain justice from the king and
council against the duke of Burgundy for the
murder of her late lord and husband, Louis
duke of Orleans. The duke of Burgundy was
much rejoiced at this event, for the duchess
had bitterly carried on her prosecution against
him.</p>

<p>Her heart was buried at Paris, near that
of her husband, and her body in the church
of the canons at Blois. After her death,
Charles, her eldest son, was duke of Orleans
and of Valois, count of Blois and of Beaumont,
lord of Coni and of Ast, with many other
lordships:&mdash;Philip, the second son, was count
of Vertus,&mdash;and John, the youngest, was named
count of Angoul&ecirc;me. These three brothers,
and one sister, thus became orphans, but they
had been very well educated; yet, by the deaths
of the duke and duchess of Orleans, they were
much weakened in support and advice,&mdash;and
several of the king’s ministers were not so
zealous to prosecute the duke of Burgundy as
they had been. This was very apparent in the
negotiations which took place some little time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
after the death of the duchess, between the
duke of Burgundy and the children of Orleans;
for although the treaty sent by the king was not
wholly to the liking of the duke, as has been
said, yet it was so corrected that the parties
accepted of it, in the following terms:</p>

<p>First, it was ordered by the king and his
great council, that the duke of Burgundy
should depart from Paris with his men at
arms, and return to his own country, where
he was to remain until a certain day, namely,
the first Wednesday in February, when he was
to meet the king at the town of Chartres,
accompanied only by one hundred gentlemen
at arms, and the children of Orleans with
fifty. It was also ordered, that duke William,
count of Hainault, should have under his
command four hundred of the king’s men at
arms, to preserve the peace. It was also
ordered, that the duke of Burgundy, when he
appeared before the king, should be attended
by one of his council, who should repeat the
words he was to say; and the duke, in
confirmation of them, was to add, ‘We will
and agree that it should be thus.’</p>

<p>Afterward, according to the tenor of the
treaty, the king was to say to the duke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Burgundy, ‘We will, that the count de Vertus,
our nephew, have one of your daughters in
marriage.’ The duke was by this treaty to
assign over to his daughter three thousand
livres parisis yearly, and give her one hundred
and fifty thousand golden francs.</p>

<p>When this treaty had been concluded,
duke William set out from Paris for Hainault;
and shortly after, the duke of Burgundy
disbanded his men at arms, and left Paris to
go to Lille, whither he had summoned the
duke of Brabant his brother, duke William
and the bishop of Liege, his brothers-in-law,
and many other great lords.</p>

<p>At this period, there was a great quarrel
between the duke of Brabant and duke
William. It was caused by the father of
duke William having borrowed in former
times from the late duchess of Brabant one
hundred and fifty thousand florins to carry on
a war against some of his rebellious subjects in
Holland, which sum the duke of Brabant had
claimed as belonging to him. He had in
consequence, by the advice of his Brabanters,
taken possession of a castle called Heusden<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>,
situated between Brabant and Holland.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy took great pains
to make up the quarrel between these two
princes, that they might the more effectually
assist him in his plans, which were very
extensive. After this business had been
settled, and the parties had separated, duke
William assembled in Hainault, according to
the king of France’s orders, four hundred men
at arms and as many archers. The principal
lords among them were, the counts de Namur,
de Conversant and de Salmes. The duke of
Burgundy, conformably to the treaty, set out,
the day after Ash-Wednesday, attended by his
son-in-law the count de Penthievre<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>, and lay
at Bapaume. Thence he went to Paris, with
duke William, the above-named lords, the
count de St Pol, the count de Vaudemont<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>,
and several others of the nobility.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 2d day of March, they
arrived all together at the town of Gallardon,
four leagues distant from Chartres. The
Wednesday following, duke William of Holland
advanced with his body of forces to Chartres,
where the king then was. On the ensuing
Saturday, the duke of Burgundy set out from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Gallardon, to wait on the king, escorted by six
hundred men at arms; but when he approached
Chartres, he dismissed them all, excepting one
hundred light horsemen, in compliance with
the treaty, and thus entered Chartres about
ten o’clock in the morning, riding strait to the
church as far as the cloisters of the canons,
where he was lodged.</p>

<p>At this same time, the duke of Orleans,
in company with his brother the count de
Vertus, and, according to the treaty, attended
by only fifty men at arms, entered the church
of our Lady at Chartres, with the king their
uncle, the queen, the duke of Acquitaine, and
several princes of the blood.</p>

<p>That the king and lords might not be
pressed upon by the spectators, and that all
might plainly see the ceremony, a scaffolding
was erected in the church, on which the king
was seated near the crucifix. Round him were
placed the queen, the dauphin and dauphiness,
daughter to the duke of Burgundy, the kings
of Sicily and Navarre, the dukes of Berry and
Bourbon; the cardinal de Bar, the marquis du
Pont his brother, the archbishop of Sens, and
the bishop of Chartres, with other counts,
prelates, and the family of Orleans were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
behind the king. At the entrance of the
church, by the king’s orders, were a body of
men at arms drawn up in battle-array.</p>

<p>It was not long before the duke of
Burgundy entered the church, and on his
advancing toward the king, all the lords,
excepting the king, queen and dauphin, rose
up from their seats. The duke, on his
approach to the king, kneeled down with his
advocate the lord d’Ollehaing, who repeated
to the king the following words:</p>

<p>‘Sire, behold here my lord of Burgundy,
your subject and cousin, who is thus come
before you, because he has heard you are
angry with him, for the action he has
committed against the person of the late duke
of Orleans your brother, for the good of
yourself and your kingdom,&mdash;the truth of
which he is ready to declare and prove to you,
whenever you shall please. My lord, therefore,
entreats of you, in the most humble manner
possible, that you would be pleased to withdraw
from him your anger, and restore him to your
good graces.’ When the lord d’Ollehaing
had said this, the duke of Burgundy himself
addressed the king, saying, ‘Sire, I entreat
this of you:’&mdash;when instantly the duke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Berry, seeing the king made no reply, bade
the duke of Burgundy retire some paces
behind,&mdash;which being done, the duke of Berry,
kneeling before the king, said something to
him in a low voice,&mdash;and immediately the
dauphin, the kings of Sicily and Navarre, with
the duke of Berry, knelt down to the king, and
said, ‘Sire, we supplicate that you would be
pleased to listen to the prayer of your cousin
the duke of Burgundy.’ The king answered
them, ‘We will that it be so,&mdash;and we grant
it from our love to you.’</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy then approached
the king, who said to him,&mdash;‘Fair cousin, we
grant your request, and pardon you fully for
what you have done.’ After this, he advanced,
with the lord d’Ollehaing, toward the children
of Orleans, who, as I have said, were behind
the king weeping much.</p>

<p>The lord d’Ollehaing addressed them,
saying, ‘My lords, behold the duke of
Burgundy, who entreats of you to withdraw
from your hearts whatever hatred or revenge
you may harbour within them, for the act
perpetrated against the person of my lord of
Orleans, your father, and that henceforward
ye may remain good friends.’ The duke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Burgundy then added, ‘And I beg this of
you.’ No answer being made, the king
commanded them to accede to the request of
his fair cousin the duke of Burgundy. Upon
which they replied, ‘Sire, since you are pleased
to command us, we grant him his request, and
shall extinguish all the hatred we bore him;
for we should be sorry to disobey you in any
thing that may give you pleasure.’</p>

<p>The cardinal de Bar then, by the king’s
orders, brought an open Bible, on which the
two parties, namely, the two sons of the late
duke of Orleans and the duke of Burgundy
swore on the holy evangelists, touching them
with their hands, that they would mutually
preserve a firm peace towards each other,
without any open or secret attempts contrary
to the full meaning of their oaths. When
this was done, the king said, ‘We will that
henceforth ye be good friends; and I most
strictly enjoin, that neither of you attempt
any thing to the loss or hurt of the other, nor
against any persons who are attached to you,
or who may have given you advice or assistance;
and that you show no hatred against any one
on this occasion, under pain of offending against
our royal authority,&mdash;excepting, however, those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
who actually committed this murder, who shall
be for ever banished from our kingdom.’</p>

<p>After this speech of the king, these princes
again swore they would faithfully abide by their
treaty. The duke of Burgundy then advanced
to salute the wife of the dauphin, the duke of
Acquitaine; and about an hour after this
ceremony had taken place the duke took his
leave of the king, queen, and the lords present,
and set out from Chartres for Gallardon, where
he dined. Many who were there were very
much rejoiced that matters had gone off so
well; but others were displeased, and murmured,
saying, that henceforward it would be no great
offence to murder a prince of the blood, since
those who had done so were so easily acquitted,
without making any reparation, or even begging
pardon.</p>

<p>The duke of Orleans and his brother
shortly after took leave of the king, queen,
dauphin, and the lords of the court, and
returned, with their attendants, to Blois,
whence they had come, not well satisfied, any
more than their council, with the peace that
had been made.</p>

<p>The marquis du Pont, son to the duke of
Bar, and cousin to the duke of Burgundy, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
before this day was not beloved by him, on
account of the murder of the duke of Orleans,
followed him to Gallardon, where they dined
publicly together in great friendship and
concord. About two o’clock in the afternoon
duke William, the count de St Pol, and other
great lords, visited the duke of Burgundy at
his lodgings in Gallardon, and then returned
together toward Paris.</p>

<p>The king, the queen, the dauphin, and
the other kings, princes and cardinals, arrived
at Paris on Mid-Lent Sunday; and the dukes
of Burgundy and of Holland, with the cardinal
de Bordeaux, who was at that time in Paris,
on his way to the council of Pisa, went out
to meet them, followed by upwards of two
hundred thousand Parisians of both sexes,
eager to receive the king, singing carols, as he
entered the gates, and conducting him with
great rejoicings to his palace.</p>

<p>They were very happy that the king was
returned to Paris, and also that a peace had
been concluded respecting the death of the
late duke of Orleans. They attributed the
whole to the great mercy of God, who had
permitted that such strong symptoms of a civil
war should be so readily extinguished; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
they did not foresee or consider the consequences
that ensued.</p>

<p>The greater part of the Parisians were
obstinately attached to the duke of Burgundy,
through the hope that by his means all the
most oppressive taxes would be abolished; but
they did not see clearly all the mischiefs that
afterward befel the kingdom and themselves,&mdash;for
in a very short time, as you shall hear, a
most cruel contention broke out between the
families of Orleans and Burgundy.</p>

<p class="hang">THE KING OF FRANCE HAS A SEVERE RETURN
OF HIS DISORDER.&mdash;THE MARRIAGE OF THE
COUNT DE NEVERS WITH THE DAMSEL OF
COUCY.&mdash;THE WAR OF AM&Eacute; DE VIRY, A
SAVOYARD, WITH THE DUKE OF BOURBON.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">At</span> the beginning of this year, Charles king
of France was much oppressed with his usual
disorder. On this account, when the kings of
Navarre and Sicily, and the duke of Berry, had
properly provided, in conjunction with the duke
of Burgundy, for the state of the king, and the
government of the realm, they went to visit
their own territories. In like manner, the
duke of Burgundy, went to the marriage of
his brother Philip count of Nevers, who took
to wife the damsel of Coucy, daughter to sir
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Enguerrand de Coucy<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>, formerly lord and
count of Soissons, and niece by the mother’s
side to the duke of Lorraine and to the count
de Vaudemont; which marriage was celebrated
in the town of Soissons.</p>

<p>This ceremony was performed on Saint
George’s day, and the feasts and entertainments
lasted for three days afterward. There were
present the duchess of Lorraine<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and the
countess of Vaudemont<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>, who had come
expressly thither to do honour to the lady of
Coucy and her daughter.</p>

<p>When these feasts were over, the duke of
Burgundy, attended by his son-in-law the count
de Penthievre, set out for Burgundy; and
shortly after, the count de Nevers conducted
his wife, and the duchess of Lorraine and the
countess of Vaudemont, to his county of
Rethel, where she was received with every
token of joy.</p>

<p>During this time, the duke of Bourbon
was challenged by Am&eacute; de Viry, a Savoyard,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
and a poor blade in comparison with the duke
of Bourbon; nevertheless, he committed much
damage by fire and sword in the countries of
Bresse and Beaujolois. The duke was very
indignant at this, and assembled a large body
of men at arms and archers to punish and
conquer him. He ordered his son, the count
de Clermont, to lead on the van, and he
speedily followed in person.</p>

<p>In his company were the counts de la
Marche and de Vend&ocirc;me, the lord d’Albret,
constable of France, Louis de Baviere, brother
to the queen, Montagu, grand master of the
king’s household, the lord de la Heuse and
many more great lords, who advanced with
a numerous body of men to the county of
Beaujolois.</p>

<p>Am&eacute; de Viry was informed of the great
force which the duke of Bourbon was marching
against him, and dared not wait his arrival; for
he had not strength enough to garrison the
forts he had taken. On his retreat, he
marched to a town called Bourg-en-Bresse,
which belonged to the earl of Savoy, his lord.
The earl, however, would not support him
against his great uncle, the duke of Bourbon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
but gave him up, on condition that Am&eacute;
should make every amends in his power for
the mischiefs he had done, and should surrender
himself to one of the prisons of the duke, until he
should have completely made him satisfaction,
but that no harm of any sort should be done to
his person.</p>

<p>The duke of Bourbon gladly received him,
and thanked his nephew for his friendship.&mdash;This
caused a quarrel of some standing to be
made up; for the earl of Savoy had declared
his great uncle owed him homage for his lands
of Beaujolois, which he would not pay,&mdash;but
now the dispute was mutually referred by them
to the duke of Berry.</p>

<p>When these matters were concluded, the
duke of Bourbon returned to France, and
disbanded his forces. Some time after, by
means which Viry made use of with the duke,
he obtained his liberty. Waleran count de
St Pol intended being of this expedition with
the duke of Bourbon, and raised a large force;
but on marching near Paris, he was ordered
not to proceed further, and to return to the
frontiers of the Boulonois, where he had been
specially commissioned by the king.

<p class="hang">TWO COMBATS TAKE PLACE AT PARIS IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE KING.&mdash;&mdash;THE DEATH
OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS.&mdash;&mdash;THE
COUNCIL AT PISA.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">About</span> Ascension-day, the king of France,
who had been grievously ill, was restored to
health,&mdash;and in consequence, the dukes of
Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, with many
other lords, instantly returned to Paris. Two
combats were ordained to be fought in the
square behind St Martin des Champs, in the
presence of the king and the aforesaid lords.
One was between a breton knight, called sir
William Batailler, and an Englishman, named
sir John Carmien, for a breach of faith.</p>

<p>When they were met, and Montjoye king
at arms had proclaimed their challenges and
the causes of them, in the accustomed manner,
he bade them do their duty. Sir William,
who was the appellant, issued first out of his
pavilion, and marched proudly toward his
adversary, who was advancing to meet him.
They threw their lances without effect, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
then made use of their swords: but in this
last combat the Englishman was slightly
wounded below his armour, when the king
instantly put an end to the fight. They were
both very honourably led out of the lists, and
conducted to their lodgings.</p>

<p>The other combat was between the
seneschal of Hainault and sir John Cornwall,
an english knight of great renown, and who
had married a sister to the king of England<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>.
This combat was undertaken by the two knights
at the desire of the duke of Burgundy, when at
Lille, to show their prowess in running a few
courses with the lance and giving some strokes
with the battle-axe: but when the duke had
caused the lists to be prepared, the two
champions were ordered by the king to repair
to Paris, and to perform their deeds of arms
in his presence.</p>

<p>According to these orders, and on the
appointed day, sir John Cornwall entered the
lists first, very grandly equipped, and, galloping
his horse around, came before the king, whom
he gallantly saluted. He was followed by six
little pages mounted on as many war-horses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the two first of which were covered with
furniture of ermines, and the other four
with cloth of gold. When he had made his
obeisances, the pages retired without the lists.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the seneschal arrived,
attended by the duke of Brabant and his
brother, the count de Nevers, each holding a
rein of his horse, on his right and left. The
count de Clermont bore his battle-axe, and the
count de Penthievre his lance. When he had
made the circuit of the lists, and had saluted
the king, as sir John Cornwall had done, they
prepared to tilt with their lances; but as they
were on the point of so doing, the king caused
it to be proclaimed that they should not proceed
in this matter, which was very displeasing to
both of them, and forced them to return to
their h&ocirc;tels.</p>

<p>It was again proclaimed, by the king’s
orders, that this deed of arms should not be
carried further,&mdash;and that in future no one,
under pain of capital punishment, should,
throughout his realm, challenge another to a
duel without a substantial cause.</p>

<p>When the king had magnificently feasted
these two knights, and shown them much
honour at his court, they departed, as it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
said, for England, with the intention of
completing their deed of arms.</p>

<p>During this time, the cardinal de Bar,
son to the duke of Bar, and Guye de Roye,
archbishop of Rheims, in company with master
Peter d’Ailly, bishop of Cambray, and several
other prelates and churchmen, were journeying
to the general council which was to be held at
Pisa, and took up their lodgings one night at
a town called Voltri, on the sea-coast, about
four leagues from Genoa. At this place the
blacksmith of the archbishop had a quarrel
with a blacksmith of the town, about the price
of shoeing a horse, which proceeded from words
to blows, and the archbishop’s blacksmith killed
the other, and fled instantly for safety to the
lodgings of his master.</p>

<p>The townsmen immediately rose,&mdash;and a
great number of them came to revenge the
death of their countryman. The archbishop,
hearing of the cause of this tumult, left
his chamber, and kindly addressed them,
promising to have the injury immediately
repaired, according to their wishes; and, the
more to appease them, he delivered up his
blacksmith into the hands of the magistrate
of the place, who was a lieutenant of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Boucicaut marshal of France, then governor
of Genoa.</p>

<p>But this was of no avail,&mdash;for as the
archbishop was speaking to them, without the
door of his house, one of the mob thrust his
javelin right through his body to the heart, so
that he dropped down dead without uttering
another word. It was a great pity, for he was
a religious prelate, and of a noble family.</p>

<p>This deed, however, did not satisfy
them; for instantly after they murdered the
magistrate and the aforesaid blacksmith, and
also endeavoured to force their way into the
house, whither the cardinal de Bar and the
greater part of the others had retired, in order
to put them likewise to death.</p>

<p>They were, however, at length appeased
by the principal inhabitants, and it was
concluded that the cardinal should grant
them his pardon for what they had done
against him,&mdash;to which, indeed, he was
induced by his attendants, from their fears of
being all destroyed.</p>

<p>They never told him of the murder of
the archbishop until he was gone two leagues
from the town: on the hearing of it, he was
so troubled, and sick at heart, that he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
near falling off his mule. His attendants,
notwithstanding, made him hasten his pace as
much as they could; for they were alarmed
for their lives, after the instances they had seen,
and from the numbers of people they perceived
descending the hills, and the accustomed signs
they saw when a town is under any apprehension
of danger, and the ringing of bells in the manner
usual on these occasions.</p>

<p>These signals were sounded throughout
the country, and the peasants were seen
running down the hills to overtake them; but
when they were arrived within a league of
Genoa, the marshal Boucicaut<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> came out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
with a handsome company to meet him.
The cardinal made loud complaints to him of
the outrages that had been committed on his
people at the town of Voltri, and demanded
that he would judicially inquire into it. The
marshal replied, that he would make so severe
an example of that town that all others should
take warning from it.</p>

<p>The cardinal was then conducted into the
city of Genoa, where he was made welcome by
the churchmen and other inhabitants; and this
same day the body of the archbishop of Rheims
was brought thither, and honourably interred,&mdash;and
his obsequies were performed in the
principal church of Genoa.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the marshal Boucicaut
punished most severely all whom he could
apprehend that had committed these outrages,
with their accomplices: they were put to death
in various ways, and their houses also were
razed to the ground, that these executions
might serve for warnings to others never to
commit such cruel murders.</p>

<p>The cardinal de Bar, with his companions,
now set out from Genoa, and travelled, by easy
day’s journies, to Pisa, where were assembled a
prodigious number of cardinals, doctors in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
theology, and graduates in civil law and other
sciences, ambassadors and prelates, in obedience
to the two popes, from different kingdoms, and
from all parts of Christendom.</p>

<p>After many councils had been held on
the schism in the church, they came at last to
this conclusion: they unanimously condemned
the two rival popes as heretics, schismatics,
obstinate in evil, and perturbators of the peace
of our holy mother the church. This sentence
was passed in the presence of twenty-four
cardinals, at the gates of Pisa, before all the
people, the 15th day of June, in the year
aforesaid.</p>

<p>The same cardinals, after invoking the
grace and assistance of the holy Spirit, entered
into conclave, where they remained until the
16th day of the same month, when they finished
their election. They chose Peter of Candia, so
named from being a native of that island: he
was of the order of Friars Minors, created a
doctor in theology at Paris, archbishop of
Milan and cardinal; and, when consecrated
sovereign of the true and holy catholic church,
he took the name of Pope Alexander V.</p>

<p>O, most powerful God! how great was
the joy thus caused, through thy never-failing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
grace; for it is impossible to relate the shoutings
and acclamations that resounded for more than
a league round the city of Pisa. But what
shall we say of the city of Paris? Why, when
this joyful news was brought thither, on the
8th of July, they incessantly shouted, night
and day, ‘Long live Alexander V. our pope!’
in all the squares and streets, and entertained
all passengers with meat and drink, from their
heartfelt happiness. When the ceremony of
consecrating the pope was over, letters were
sent to different persons, the more fully to
explain the proceedings of the council. I shall
insert the one written by the abbot of Saint
Maixence to the bishop of Poitiers, the tenor of
which was as follows.</p>

<p>‘Reverend father, and my redoubted lord,
after my humble respects being accepted, I
know that your reverence would gladly be
informed of the proceedings of the council,
which has been held in the city of Pisa, and
any intelligence concerning it; and it is for
this reason I have indited the following lines
to your reverence.</p>

<p>‘First, then, on the 25th day of March
all the cardinals, who had been created by
both popes, and all the prelates then in Pisa,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
assembled in the church of St Martin, which
is situated beyond the river, on the road
leading to Florence, and thence being dressed
in their robes, with mitres on their heads,
they made a grand procession to the cathedral
church, which is as distant from that of Saint
Martin as our church of N&ocirc;tre Dame at Paris
is from that of St Martin des Champs. There
the council always afterward assembled; and
on this first day, mass was celebrated with great
solemnity: the sermon was preached by my
lord cardinal of Milan, of the order of Friars
Minors, a great theologian. When the service
was over, the morrow was fixed on to open
the council, and the two popes were summoned
to attend on that day at the gates of the church
by two cardinals; but neither of them appeared,
nor any one for them.</p>

<p>‘The council continued to sit till the
latter end of March, when the popes were
again summoned to appear, but neither of
them obeyed. The council therefore having
required the two rival popes to come before
them, on account of the schism that has
reigned in the church, and neither of them
appearing, or sending any one to make
satisfactory answers for them, and the term
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
allotted for their appearing being elapsed,
declared them both guilty of the schism that
distresses the church, and of contumacy, by
their conduct, toward the council.</p>

<p>‘The council ordered prosecutions to be
carried on against both of the popes, on the
Monday after Quasimodo-Sunday, the 15th
of April, when my lords cardinals celebrated
together the service of the holy week. On
Good Friday, my lord cardinal d’Orsini
celebrated divine service in Saint Martin’s
church; and a secular doctor of divinity,
from Bologna la Grassa, preached an excellent
sermon.</p>

<p>‘My lords cardinals were all present at
the ceremonies of Easter Sunday. During
the ensuing week they assembled in council,
sometimes alone, at others they called in the
prelates, to deliberate on the state of affairs,
and what line of conduct should be pursued;
and every thing was carried on with mutual
good will on all sides. This week the
ambassadors from the king of the Romans
arrived at Pisa.</p>

<p>‘On the Sunday of Quasimodo, an
italian bishop said mass before the cardinals;
and a cordelier from Languedoc, a doctor in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
divinity preached the sermon, in which he
greatly praised my lords cardinals from France,
and such as were seeking to restore peace to
the church,&mdash;but very harshly treated the two
contending popes, calling them schismatics,
heretics, and traitorous enemies to God and to
his church. He chose for his text, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jesus dixit,
Pax vobis,</span>’ which he handled extraordinarily
well.</p>

<p>‘The following Monday, the cardinals,
prelates, ambassadors, and procurators then
present, made oath to obey the decisions of
the council. Mass was then chaunted, and
succeeded by many prayers; then the litany
was sung, at which all the cardinals and
prelates, dressed in their robes and mitres,
attended, and so continued as long as the
sittings of the council lasted, which made it
a handsome sight to see.</p>

<p>‘This same day, the council gave
audience to the ambassadors from Robert
king of the Romans; and the bishop of
Verdun, on the part of Robert, who favoured
pope Gregory as much as he could, began his
harangue, taking for his theme, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pax vobis.</span>’
He made many mischievous propositions, to
divide and distract the council, in obedience
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
to his master, and to serve the false pope
Gregory. There were with this bishop an
archbishop of a foreign order, and a numerous
body of attendants. When the bishop had
made his propositions, the ambassadors were
required to deliver the same in writing, and to
show their procurations from their lord. A day
was then fixed to hear the answer of the council
to their propositions; but before this day arrived,
the ambassadors went away without taking leave
of their host.</p>

<p>‘This week of Quasimodo, the lord
Malatesta came to Pisa in great state: he had
given to pope Gregory one of his castles called
Rimini<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>, and made the following request to
the cardinals assembled, as well on the part of
pope Gregory as on his own,&mdash;namely, that it
would please the members of the council to
adjourn its sittings, and change the place of
its meeting; that if they would so do, pope
Gregory would attend personally, provided
the situation were in a place of safety, and
that he might have security for his coming to
and going from it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>‘In consequence of this request, the
cardinals summoned the prelates to notify it
to them; but they unanimously declared, they
would neither consent that the place of holding
the council should be changed nor that the
meetings of it should be adjourned. This
answer was very agreeable to the cardinals.
The lord Malatesta, therefore, returned without
having succeeded in his object; but his anger
was appeased by some of the cardinals, his
friends and acquaintance.</p>

<p>‘From the 15th of April, the council
continued sitting to the 23d of the said month,&mdash;when,
after the solemnity of the mass, the
advocate-fiscal demanded, that the council
should declare, that the conjunction of the
two colleges of cardinals of the holy church
of Rome had been, and was, lawful and
canonical at the time it was formed.</p>

<p>‘Item, that it should declare, that this
holy council is duly canonical, by the cardinals
of both colleges assembling for so excellent a
purpose.</p>

<p>‘Item, that this holy council has been
called together by the cardinals of both colleges
with a good intent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>‘Item, that it has been assembled at a
convenient opportunity.</p>

<p>‘Item, that it should declare, that this
holy council, as representing the universal
church of God, has a right to take cognizance
of the merits of the two competitors for the
papacy.</p>

<p>‘Item, that a narrative should this day
be read of the introduction and commencement
of the schism that took place from the time
of the death of pope Gregory X. until the
convention of this holy general council.</p>

<p>‘In this narrative were displayed all the
tricks and deceits that had been made use of,
either individually or conjunctively by the two
rival popes.</p>

<p>‘After it had been read, the advocate
fiscal drew several conclusions against the said
rivals and their pretensions to the papacy, and
ended his harangue by demanding that they
should be deposed and punished corporally,
and that the council should proceed to the
election of a true and holy pope.</p>

<p>‘The sittings were prolonged to Saturday
the 27th day of the same month, when the
ambassadors from the king of England entered
the council with a most magnificent state.&mdash;The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
bishop of Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>, in the diocese
of Canterbury, made a handsome speech,
urging the necessity of peace and union in the
church.</p>

<p>‘When he had finished, the advocate-fiscal
made an interesting oration, and concluded by
demanding, through the procurator of the holy
council, that it would please to appoint a
commission of certain wise, discreet, and
experienced persons to examine witnesses as
to the notorious sins charged on the two
competitors for the papacy, and his request
was granted.</p>

<p>‘The second Sunday after Easter, mass
was celebrated before the cardinals, and the
sermon was preached by the bishop of
Digne in Provence: he was of the order of
Friars Minors, a learned doctor in divinity,
and had ever been a great friend to Pietro
della Luna, and was well acquainted with the
tricks and cavils of both popes. This bishop
delivered a good sermon from his text of
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mercenarius fugit,</span>’ in which he discovered
many deceptions of the two rivals, in descanting
on the words of his text.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>‘The sittings were continued from this
Sunday to the 2d day of May, when mass was
said before the cardinals; and the sermon
was preached by the cardinal Prenestin, more
commonly called the cardinal of Poitiers.&mdash;He
delivered a good discourse, and chose for
his text, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libera Deus Israel ex omnibus
tribulationibus suis.</span>’ He urged in his sermon
eleven conclusive arguments against the two
popes, for refusing to give peace to the
church, and ended by requiring the council,
in consideration of their obstinate contumacy,
to proceed against them and provide a pastor
for the flock of God.</p>

<p>‘On the 2d day of May, there was a general
meeting of the council, when, after the usual
solemnities, a very renowned doctor of Bologna
made a reply to the insidious propositions of
the bishop of Verdun, on the part of the
emperor Robert. He condemned, by arguments
drawn from divine, canon, and civil law, all that
had been advanced by the bishop; and his
reasoning was so just and clear that the council
were much satisfied and comforted.</p>

<p>‘The ensuing Sunday, mass was said
before the cardinals, and the sermon was
preached by the general of the order of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
Augustins. He was a great doctor in divinity,
and a native of Italy. He chose for his text,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum venerit ille arguet mundum de peccato,
et de justitia, et de judicio.</span>’ He discussed this
subject very well, and with a good intent.</p>

<p>‘The sittings were prolonged from this
2d of May to the 10th.&mdash;The patriarch of
Alexandria celebrated mass before the cardinals
on the feast of the revelation of St Michael, the
8th of May; and he likewise preached a sermon,
taking for his text, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Congregata est ecclesia ex
filiis Israel et omnes qui fugiebant a malis additi
sunt, et facti sunt illis ad firmamentum.</span>’ These
words are written in the 2nd and 5th chapters
of the first book of Machabees. In the course
of this sermon, he pressed six arguments against
the two rival popes.</p>

<p>‘On Friday, the 10th of May, the council,
after the usual solemnities, resumed its sittings,
when the advocate-fiscal made the following
requisitions: that the holy council would be
pleased to confirm and approve the demands
he had before made, namely, that it should
declare that the union of the two colleges of
cardinals has been and is legal; and that the
council should pronounce definitively on the
other demands he had made. The procurator
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
fiscal made a request to the council, that eight
days should be allowed for the production of
witnesses; and the council was adjourned to
the 16th of May.</p>

<p>‘On the Sunday preceding that day, mass
was said before the cardinals by the bishop of
Faenza; and the sermon preached by a native
of Arragon, a learned doctor in divinity, who
had always been of the party of Pietro della
Luna. He chose his text from one of St Paul’s
epistles, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Expurgate vetus fermentum ut sitis
nova conspersio.</span>’ He expatiated on this with
such ability that all the doctors wondered.
Drawing from it certain conclusions, he said
that the two rivals were as much popes as his
old shoes, calling them worse than Annas and
Caiaphas, and comparing them to the devils
in hell.</p>

<p>‘Such things passed in the council to
the 23d day of this present month, as I
have briefly related, on which day the
ambassadors from the king of Spain were to
come to Pisa. The number of prelates that
were present cannot be estimated, for they were
daily increased by new ones, who came from
all parts of Christendom. I should suppose
that at the last sitting of the council there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
present of cardinals, bishops, archbishops, and
abbots, wearing mitres, one hundred and forty,
without counting the non-mitred members.</p>

<p>‘There were also ambassadors from the
kings of France, England, Jerusalem, Sicily,
Cyprus, and Poland; from the dukes of
Brabant, Austria, Stephen of Bavaria, William
of Bavaria; from the counts of Cleves and of
Brandac<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>; from the marquis of Brandenbourg
and de Moraine<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>; from the archbishops of
Cologne, Mentz and Saltzbourg, and from the
bishop of Maestricht; from the grand master
of the Teutonic order; from the patriarch of
Aquileia, and from many princes in Italy.
Numbers of doctors in divinity, and in the
canon and civil law, were present, as well
from France as from other countries, and very
many procurators from divers parts of the
world, who, by the grace of God, have held
instructive and charitable conversations together
from the commencement of the council until
this moment.</p>

<p>‘In the city of Pisa are abundance of all
sorts of provisions, which are sold at reasonable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
prices; but they would be much cheaper, were
it not for the gabelles and taxes that are levied
in these countries. In my mind, Pisa is one of
the handsomest cities existing: it has a navigable
river, within a league distant, running into the
sea,&mdash;and which river brings large vessels,
laden with different merchandise, to the town.
Around the city are vineyards of white grapes
and many fine meadows.</p>

<p>‘We are very well lodged, considering
the great number of men at arms quartered in
it for its guard. The town has been conquered
by the Florentines, who have banished many
of the Pisans to prevent any treasons, and
sent them to Florence, to the amount of two
thousand; and they are obliged to show
themselves twice every day to the governor at
an appointed place, under pain of death.</p>

<p>‘Four or five thousand of the Pisans
went to ask succour from king Lancelot<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>, who,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
in compliance with their request, advanced
within five leagues of Pisa, with a force of
twenty-three thousand combatants, as well
horse as foot; but the Florentines, through
the grace of God, are well able to resist all his
power, and guard us. True it is, that this
king Lancelot ran a risk of losing his kingdom
by the union of the holy church, for he had
tyrannically seized on a large part of the
patrimony of St Peter.</p>

<p>‘It was said that there were certain
ambassadors from Pietro della Luna at the
council, not with the intent of forwarding the
union, but of throwing every obstacle in its
way.</p>

<p>‘There were nineteen cardinals of both
colleges, at this council at Pisa, including the
cardinal de Challan, whose attendants were
arrived,&mdash;and the cardinal was to follow with
the ambassadors from Savoy.</p>

<p>‘My lords the cardinals are much
displeased with those bishops, abbots, and
chapters of cathedral churches, who have
neglected to send procurators to this general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
council. I have nothing more to send to you
at present.&mdash;Written at Pisa the 15th day of
May, by your humble monk and servant, the
abbot of St Maxence.’</p>

<p>The direction was, ‘To the reverend
father in <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, and by the grace of
God, lord bishop of Poitiers, and chancellor
to my lord the duke of Berry.’</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I shall</span> now transcribe the letters written by
the ambassadors from the university of Paris
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
to the council at Pisa, the contents of which
are as follows.</p>

<p>‘Reverend fathers, lords and masters, after
offering you our humble recommendation, may
it please you to know, that we write to inform
you of the conclusions entered into by the
council-general, which has held thirteen
sittings.</p>

<p>‘The two rival popes, having for some
time been waited for in vain, notwithstanding
the summons sent them, have been declared
contumacious in respect to schism and the
faith. Many decrees were passed against
them for their contumacy, and commissioners
were appointed to examine witnesses against
them.</p>

<p>‘Item, the council-general approved of
the union of the colleges of cardinals, the
citations served on the contending popes, and
the place of meeting of the council, as being
perfectly convenient and secure. The council
declared, that it was supreme on earth to take
cognizance and judge of the charges brought
against the contenders for the papacy. It was
also declared by the council, that it had been
lawful for any one to quit his obedience to
either of the popes, from the moment they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
had promised to abdicate the papacy; and
that all suits and processes, carried on against
such as had quitted their obedience to either,
were annulled and of no weight.</p>

<p>‘Public charges were then made against
them, and an interlocutory sentence passed on
the notorious sins of the two competitors.
This day, doctor Peter Paoul declared, in full
council, your opinions, and took for his text,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Congregabuntur filii Jud&aelig; et filii Israel et
facient sibimet caput unum.</span>’ That is to say,
Those who are come to this council, and such
as shall hereafter come, will choose from
among themselves a head to the church.
A little before this, doctor Dominic le Petit
had made a solemn harangue before all the
cardinals, taking for his text, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principes
populorum congregati sunt cum Deo Abraham.</span>’
The cardinals and prelates of the holy church
are styled princes of the people. On this day
also, the theologians, to the number of six
score and three, delivered their opinions, and
eighty of them are your friends and supporters.</p>

<p>‘Item, this day it has been ordered that
the two rival popes be summoned to appear at
the doors of the church on Wednesday the
5th of July, to hear their definitive sentence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>‘Gregory has sent a bull to the English
to entreat they would be of his party, with
Robert king of the Romans, to change the
place of holding the council, and that they
would please to be of his council; but he
labours in vain, for the English, Germans,
Bohemians, Polanders, French, those from
Cyprus, Rhodes and Italy, are all unanimous,
excepting Robert, whose ambassadors have
gone away.</p>

<p>‘Few prelates have come to this council
from the kingdom of Hungary. King
Ladislaus wrote that he intended being here
in person, but he is fully occupied in his war
against the infidels.</p>

<p>‘Pietro Mastin, called della Luna, has
issued a most thundering bull, in which he
admonishes the cardinals to return to their
duty toward him; and should they refuse, he
prohibits them from attempting to make
another election, menacing them, in case of
disobedience, with excommunication and other
penalties against them and their supporters.</p>

<p>‘Reverend fathers, and redoubted masters,
we have nothing more for the present to write
to you, except that all nations seem inclined to
a reformation in the church, which the new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
pope, whom it shall please God to elect, will
be forced to comply with. Should you have
any orders to send us, we are ready to obey
them to the utmost of our power. Beseeching
you humbly to keep all our concerns in your
consideration, may the Sovereign Lord have
you under his guard!</p>

<p>‘Written at Pisa the 29th day of May.’
Underneath were signed the names of Dominic
le Petit, Pierre Paoul de Quesnoy, Jean Pere
Ponce, Vincent, Eustace de Faquemberge,
Arnoul Vibrant, Jean Bourlet, dit Fran&ccedil;ois.&mdash;Master
Pierre de Poingny and master
Guillaume le Charpentier did not sign the
above, because they were absent.</p>

<p>Here follows the sentence on the two
contending popes.</p>

<p>‘This present holy council, assembled in
the name of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, withdraws itself
from the obedience to Pietro della Luna, called
Pope Benedict XIII. and from Angelo Corrario,
called Pope Gregory XII.; and the holy council
decrees and declares, that all true Catholics
ought to do the same.</p>

<p>‘Item, the same holy synod, as
representative and judge of the universal
church, after mature consideration and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
examination of witnesses concerning the
horrible sins of the two contending popes,
pronounces, in the church of Pisa, this its
definitive sentence, that both popes be
deprived of every honour and dignity,
especially that of the papacy. It also
pronounces, that they be separated from the
holy church, in conformity to the sacred
canons, and by the above sentence, forbidding
all persons to have the boldness ever to defend
or obey either of them as pope.</p>

<p>‘The council forbids any Christians
from obeying or showing favour to either,
notwithstanding any oath or promise they
may have made or entered into, under pain of
excommunication,&mdash;and decrees, that whoever
shall disobey this sentence shall be delivered into
the hands of secular justice, and condemned
as one who favours heretics, and that he
shall be punished according to the divine
commandments, and the decrees of the holy
canons.</p>

<p>‘The council also declares and pronounces,
that all promotions of cardinals made by the
two rival popes, namely, those made by Angelo
Corrario since the 3d day of May, and by Pietra
della Luna since the 15th day of June, of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
year 1408, have been and are of no effect, and
are annulled by this definitive sentence. It also
declares, that every judgment given by the
aforesaid competitors for the papacy, to the
prejudice of the holy church, against any kings,
princes, lords, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops,
prelates of the church, or other private persons,
are of no effect; and the holy synod has ordained
that proceedings to the contrary, and to the
welfare of the holy church shall commence on
the ensuing Monday, the 10th day of June.’</p>

<p>The above sentences and declarations were
passed in the general council of Pisa, the 5th
day of June, in the year 1409.</p>

<p>The 26th day of June, in the year 1409,
Peter of Candia, a Cordelier and native of
Greece, doctor of divinity, and usually called
the Cardinal of Milan, was unanimously
chosen pope by the cardinals at Pisa, with
the approbation of the general council, and
called Alexander V. who, immediately after his
election, published the following bull.</p>

<p>‘Alexander, bishop and servant to the
servants of God, to the bishop of Paris, health
and apostolical benediction. Praise and glory
be to the God of heaven for having instilled
into the minds of men a desire of peace on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
earth, and who, through his benign grace and
mercy, has brought about an union of his
Christian people, hitherto long disturbed by
a dangerous schism.</p>

<p>‘Who is there among mankind that will
not most heartily rejoice at this happy event,
on considering the perils souls must run when
such divisions take place in the holy church,
and which have for so long a time been
encouraged by sacrilegious schismatics?</p>

<p>‘Our blessed God, taking pity on his
people, who had long suffered from this
division, opened and illuminated the minds
of the holy general council, who have justly
condemned the two popes, according to the
sacred canons, as enemies to God and his
holy church, by their enormous, horrible, and
notorious sins.</p>

<p>‘When our brethren, the venerable
Cardinals of the holy roman church, of whom
we were one, were desirous of finding a proper
pastor for the Christian flock, after the usual
ceremonies and solemnities, with the consent
of the council-general, they entered into
conclave, where, after long discussions, they
unanimously selected our humble self, then
cardinal-priest of the church of the Twelve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Apostles, and chose us bishop of Rome.
Although we knew our unworthiness of so
great a charge, considering our weakness, yet,
always confiding in the aid of God, we have
accepted of it.</p>

<p>‘Venerable brother, these things we notify
to thee, as one loving and desirous of the peace
of the church, as we have been well informed;
and we exhort thee and thy flock to render
thanks to the all-powerful God for this most
gracious gift which he has granted to us. We
have so great an affection for thy worthy person,
that we inform thee, that we are ready to serve
thee and thine to the utmost of our power.&mdash;This
present letter we have intrusted to be
delivered to thee by our well-beloved son, that
notable man Paulin d’Arc&eacute;, esquire of honour,
chamberlain, and our loyal servant.&mdash;Given at
Pisa the 8th day of July, in the first year of our
papacy.’</p>

<p>It is the good pleasure of our very sacred
lord Alexander V. by divine Providence, pope,
that all promotions, translations, confirmations
and collations whatever, and all consecrations
of bishops and others, that have been granted
or performed by the two competitors for the
papacy, shall be considered as strictly legal,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
provided they were effected prior to passing of
the definitive sentence, and done according to
the regulations of the canon law.</p>

<p>Item, it is also the pleasure of the general
council, that our aforesaid lord shall give his
orders concerning the archbishop of Genoa.</p>

<p>Item, the benefices in the church, that
had been given by ordinary judges, have the
approbation of the holy council to continue to
them to whom they have been given.</p>

<p>Item, the holy council approves of
proceedings being instituted against all who
shall obstinately obey or favour either of the
late competitors for the papacy, Pietro della
Luna or Angelo Corrario,&mdash;and the council
condemns such, as guilty of schism and
notorious heresy, and ordains that they be
punished according to the regulations of the
sacred canons.</p>

<p>Item, it is ordered, that should the cardinal
de Flisque<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> be willing to return to his duty,
and appear personally within two months, he
shall be kindly received, and enjoy all his
honours and benefices, which he obtained in

<p class="hang">THE DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF PARIS.&mdash;&mdash;THE
MARRIAGES, OF THE DUKE OF
BRABANT WITH THE NIECE OF THE
KING OF BOHEMIA,&mdash;OF THE CONSTABLE
OF FRANCE’S DAUGHTER WITH THE SON
OF MONTAGU, GRAND MASTER OF THE
HOUSEHOLD,&mdash;OF THE KING OF CYPRUS
WITH CHARLOTTE DE BOURBON.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> these days, the lord John d’Orgemont,
bishop of Paris, departed this life, in his
episcopal palace, about the end of June. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
was succeeded in his bishoprick by the lord
Gerard de Montagu, bishop of Poitiers,
chancellor to the duke of Berry, and brother
to the grand master of the king’s household and
to the archbishop of Sens. He was honourably
received in the cathedral church of N&ocirc;tre Dame
in Paris, the 22d day of September following.</p>

<p>The king of France, the dukes of Berry,
Burgundy, and Bourbon, the king of Navarre,
and several other princes, with prelates and
churchmen without number, were present at
his consecration. With the aid of the grand
master, his brother, the feast he gave on the
occasion was the most magnificent ever seen,
in regard to the quantity of gold and silver
plate, and the diversity and abundance of
meats and liquors. From this grand display,
the princes observed that the grand master
governed the king as he pleased; and they
began to form suspicions as to the uprightness
of his conduct.</p>

<p>On the 16th day of July following, duke
Anthony of Brabant married, at Brussels, the
niece of the king of Bohemia<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>, heiress to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
duchy of Luxembourg in right of her father.
This marriage had been concluded by the
mediation of the bishop of Ch&acirc;lons and sir
Regnier Pot.</p>

<p>Several knights, esquires, ladies and
damsels of high rank, had accompanied the
lady to Brussels, according to the orders of
the king of Bohemia, her uncle. There were
present at these nuptials the two brothers of
the duke of Brabant, the duke of Burgundy
and the count de Nevers, with their sister, wife
to duke William count de Hainault; the count
de Charolois and the countess of Cleves, children
to the duke of Burgundy; the marquis du
Pont, his brother John<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> and their sister, the
countess de St Pol<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>, all three children to the
duke de Bar; the counts de Namur and de
Conversant, with their ladies, with many more
of the great nobility of both sexes.</p>

<p>The count de Clermont, son to the duke
de Bourbon, was also there,&mdash;and when he
tilted was attended by the duke of Burgundy
and count de Nevers. The duke bore his
shield and the count his lance, to the surprise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
of many present, on account of the great
hatred that had so lately subsisted between
them for the murder of the duke of Orleans:
however, they seemed then to be in perfect
concord. This feast was abundantly served
with all sorts of provisions and wines,&mdash;and
when it was ended, the different guests retired
to their respective countries.</p>

<p>On the last day but one of the same
month of July, the marriage of the daughter
of the lord d’Albret, constable of France, with
the eldest son of Montagu<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>, grand master of
the king’s household, was solemnly celebrated.
The queen of France and numbers of the great
nobles were present,&mdash;and the whole of the
expense was paid by the king, which created
much anger and envy in several of the princes
of the blood against Montagu.</p>

<p>At this time, the truces were broken
between the kings of France and of England,
but only at sea; and a bitter naval war ensued,
to the great loss of many merchants in each
country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>On the 2d day of August, John de Lusignan,
king of Cyprus, espoused by proxy, Charlotte
de Bourbon, sister-german to the count de
la Marche. The ceremony was performed
in the castle of Melun, in the presence of
the queen of France, the duke of Acquitaine
and her other children, the king of Navarre,
the dukes of Berry and of Bourbon, the
counts de la Marche and de Clermont, the
lord Louis de Baviere, brother to the queen,
and many ladies and damsels, who greatly
amused themselves in tournaments, dances, in
feastings and other pastimes.</p>

<p>The lady Charlotte, queen of Cyprus, was
very handsome, and well endowed with noble
and gracious manners. On the conclusion of
these feasts, she departed for Cyprus, most
honourably accompanied by the nobles so
ordered by her brother, and also by those who
had been sent to her from the king of Cyprus.
She landed at the port of Chermes, whither
the king came to meet her, much rejoiced at
her safe arrival, and conducted her, attended
by the greater part of the nobility of the island,
to Nicosia, where were made many feasts,
according to the custom of the country.
They reigned for a long time with much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
honour, and had two children, of whom more
shall be spoken hereafter.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XI">CHAP. XI.</h2>

<p class="hang">THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY HOLDS A GREAT
COUNCIL AT LILLE ON HIS AFFAIRS.&mdash;THE
DEATH OF THE DUCHESS OF ORLEANS.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">On</span> the 5th of August, and the eight succeeding
days, duke John of Burgundy held a grand
council in his town of Lille, on his own affairs,
and on the means of reconciling his brother
and brother-in-law, the duke of Brabant and
duke William of Holland, who had quarrelled
for a cause before mentioned.</p>

<p>With these two dukes, there were also
present the duke of Burgundy’s sister, the wife
of duke William, the bishop of Liege, and the
count de Namur. At length, the duke of
Burgundy made peace between them, on
condition that duke William should pay to the
duke of Brabant, for all his demand of debt,
the sum of seventy thousand golden florins of
the coin of France, by different instalments.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>When this had been settled, the duke of
Burgundy went, about the middle of August,
to Paris, by orders from the king and royal
council: he was accompanied by many men
at arms, whom he quartered in the villages
round Paris. The reason why he was attended
by such a force was, because the duke of
Brittany had lately brought from England
great numbers of English, and, in conjunction
with his Bretons, was carrying on a sharp
war against the old countess of Penthievre<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
and her lands. The queen of France and the
king’s ministers were much displeased at this
conduct of the duke of Brittany, because it
was to the prejudice of the realm. The duke
had increased this displeasure against him by
having beaten and ill treated his duchess,
daughter to the king of France, for blaming
him on account of his undertaking this war.</p>

<p>It was therefore intended, that the duke
of Burgundy should march the forces he had
brought, attended by other princes and
captains, against the duke of Brittany, to
conquer his country and oblige him to submit
to the king. The duke of Burgundy was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
very desirous of succouring the countess and
her fair son, the count de Penthievre; but
while the preparations were making, the duke
of Brittany, informed by some of his friends
that he was in the ill graces of his mother in
law, the queen of France, and of those who
governed the king, sent, by advice of his
council, certain ambassadors to Paris, to offer
to submit his differences with the countess de
Penthievre to the king and council, which was
at length accepted, through the interference of
the king of Navarre.</p>

<p>The countess de Penthievre and her son
were summoned to Paris, whither also came
the duke of Brittany, when, after some
discussions, peace was made between them.</p>

<p>In this same month, Isabella, the king of
France’s eldest daughter, and dowager queen
of England, but wife to Charles duke of
Orleans, died in childbed. The duke bitterly
lamented her loss, but received some consolation
out of regard to the daughter she had brought
him.</p>

<p>The patriarch of Alexandria, bishop of
Carcassonne, succeeded Guy de Roye (whose
murder has been noticed) in the archbishoprick
of Rheims, and the archbishop of Bourges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
succeeded to the patriarchate. Doctor William
Bouratier, secretary to the king, was nominated
archbishop of Bourges; and nearly about this
time died doctor Peter Paoul, and was succeeded
in his dignities by doctor Gilles des Champs,
almoner to the king. Louis de Harcourt,
brother to the count de Harcourt, was
appointed archbishop of Rouen.</p>

<p class="hang">THE TOWN OF GENOA REBELS AGAINST
BOUCICAUT, MARSHAL OF FRANCE, THE
GOVERNOR, WHILE OBEYING A SUMMONS
FROM THE DUKE OF MILAN.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Boucicaut</span>, marshal of France, was at this
time governor of Genoa, and resided there.
He was called upon by the duke of Milan
and his brother, the count of Pavia<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>, to
settle a dispute which had arisen between
them, respecting part of their dominions. He
accepted the invitation, thinking he should do
an agreeable service to the duke of Milan, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
not suspecting any trick in the matter. But
during his absence, the inhabitants of Genoa
rebelled against his government, and sent for
some of their allies and accomplices to come
to them.</p>

<p>They cruelly murdered the marshal’s
lieutenant, the chevalier de Colletrie, named
Chollette, a native of Auvergne, which the
other Frenchmen hearing of, fled into the
forts, for fear of suffering a similar fate.
These were instantly besieged by the Genoese,
who sent for the marquis of Montferrat<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>: he
lost no time in hastening to their aid with
four thousand combatants, as they had
promised to pay him ten thousand florins
yearly,&mdash;and they immediately elected him
doge of Genoa. They also chose twelve
knights, as a council to manage public
affairs.</p>

<p>A few days after, Fassincault<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>, a very
renowned captain in Italy, and a great friend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
of the marquis of Montferrat, came to Genoa
with the intent of assisting the marquis; but
the Genoese refused to admit him, or accept
of his offers. On his return, his force,
amounting to eight thousand men, took a
town called Noefville; but the French
retreated within the castle, which was
instantly besieged.</p>

<p>When Boucicaut heard of the rebellion
of the Genoese, he set out accompanied by
his men, and the duke of Milan and the
count of Pavia, and arrived with speed at
the castle of Gaing<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>, situated between the
town of Noefville<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and Genoa, and fought
with Fassincault and his forces. In this battle,
eight hundred men were slain, the greater part
belonging to Fassincault,&mdash;and night alone
separated the combatants.</p>

<p>Boucicaut, by the advice of Enguerrand
de Bournouville and Gaiffier de la Salle, both
men at arms of acknowledged prowess,
advanced that night to the castle of Gaing,
which he won, and amply provided it with
provision and all necessary stores. Fassincault
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
remained in the town; but seeing he could not
gain the castle, he departed with his men to his
own fortresses.</p>

<p>The marshal Boucicaut carried on a severe
warfare against the Genoese and those who had
assisted them. He also sent messengers to
inform the king of France of his situation,
and to require that he would immediately
send him reinforcements of men at arms.&mdash;The
king and his great council, on receiving
this intelligence and considering the fickleness
of the Genoese, determined to proceed cautiously
against them. The king sent, at his expense,
the lords de Torsy, de Rambures, and de
Viefville, with a certain number of men at
arms, to the city of Asti, belonging to the
duke of Orleans, and near to the territory of
Genoa, with the hope of affording assistance
to Boucicaut.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Asti, they found that
the whole country was in rebellion, excepting
some forts, which held out for the French; but
as they were without the town, and could not
contain many men, from dread of wanting
provision, they were not of consequence, nor
could they do much mischief. The above
knights, therefore, perceiving they could not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
perform any essential services, resolved to return
to France.</p>

<p>All merchants, and others who came from
or had any connexions with Genoa, were now
sought after in Paris, arrested and imprisoned,
and their goods confiscated to the king’s use.
Now these Genoese had for a long time been
under obedience to the king, and had diligently
served him in many of his wars.</p>

<p class="hang">THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ASSEMBLE, AND
RESOLVE TO REFORM THE MANAGEMENT
OF THE ROYAL FINANCES.&mdash;THE DEATH OF
MONTAGU.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">At</span> this period, the following princes of the
blood,&mdash;Louis king of Navarre<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>, the dukes of
Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, and many other
great lords, were at Paris; and having learnt
that the king’s treasury was impoverished by
his officers and those who governed him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
insomuch that his plate and the greater part
of his jewels were in pawn, they one day
personally explained to the king, in the
presence of the queen, the duke of Acquitaine
and others of his council, the miserable state
of his finances, and the unworthy government
of the officers of his household. They at the
same time requested, that he would be pleased
to permit that some of them should have
power to reform in general the abuses that
had commenced with his reign, and to call to
an account, dismiss, and punish all who should
have mismanaged the finances, according as
the cases might require, without any exception
whatever.</p>

<p>This request the king granted; and for
the better carrying on their object, the greater
part of the lords before mentioned left their
own h&ocirc;tels, and resided in the king’s palace
of St Pol, where, with the advice of the
members of the parliament and the university,
they continued their reformations for many
days.</p>

<p>They soon discovered that those who had
managed the finances for the last sixteen or
twenty years had very dishonestly acquitted
themselves, and had acquired for themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and their friends immense fortunes, to the
prejudice of the state. Montagu, who had
been the principal minister of finance, was
particularly the object they aimed at,&mdash;and
they ordered him, with several others, to be
arrested and confined in the prisons of the
Ch&acirc;telet.</p>

<p>Sir Peter des Essars, provost of Paris,
was directed to put this order into execution,
with his sergeants; and by the command of
the duke of Burgundy, the lords de Heylly,
de Robais, and sir Roland de Vequerque,
were appointed to assist the provost in this
duty. Having assembled together, they, on
a certain day, met Montagu, and with him
the doctor, Martin Gouge, bishop of Chartres,
both going to hear mass at the monastery of
St Victor.</p>

<p>The provost, attended by the above lords,
on meeting them, laid his hands on both, saying,
‘I lay hands on you by virtue of the royal
authority vested in me for this purpose.’&mdash;Montagu,
hearing these words, was much
astonished, and trembled greatly; but his
courage soon returned, and he replied to the
provost, ‘What! rascal, art thou daring
enough to lay hands on me?’ But the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
provost answered, ‘Matters will not turn out
as you think,&mdash;for you must make reparation
for the many and great mischiefs you have
done.’</p>

<p>Montagu, unable to resist, was tightly
bound by the provost, and carried by him
straight to the little Ch&acirc;telet. The bishop of
Chartres was arrested with him, as he had been
president of one of the financial departments.
Montagu was several times put to the torture,
insomuch that, suspecting his end was
approaching, he asked his confessor what he
had best do: the confessor replied, ‘I see no
other remedy than your appealing from the
jurisdiction of the provost of Paris.’ This he
did; and the provost waited on the lords who
had commanded him to arrest Montagu, to
inform them, that he had appealed against his
jurisdiction. The parliament was consequently
convoked to examine into the matter; and the
members of it declared the appeal of no effect.
The lords, therefore, seeing the cause had been
judged, said to the provost, ‘Go, without
delay, accompanied by some of the populace
well armed, take thy prisoner, and finish the
matter by cutting off his head with an axe,
and fix it on a lance in the market-place.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>After these words, the populace armed
themselves, and, on the 17th of October,
assembled in bodies in the place Maubert,
and in other parts of the town. They carried
Montagu to a scaffold erected in the market
place, where, having made him strip to his
shirt, they cut off his head, and fixed it to
the end of a pike, and hung his body by the
shoulders to the highest gibbet at Montfaucon.
This execution was chiefly owing, as it was said,
to the duke of Burgundy’s hatred to him, who
even sent for a very great number of the nobles
of his countries of Burgundy, Flanders, and
Artois, to be spectators of it.</p>

<p>A little before this execution took place,
the duke of Bourbon, and his son the count
de Clermont, left Paris, indignant at the arrest
of Montagu. The duke of Orleans, his brothers,
and all of their party, were also very much
displeased that he was put to death,&mdash;but they
could not help it, for at that time they were
not listened to by the king’s council.</p>

<p>On the morrow of this event, duke William
count of Hainault arrived at Paris, having been
sent for by the duke of Burgundy. A large
company of the nobles went out of the town to
meet him; and he was most graciously received
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
by the king, the duke of Acquitaine and the
other princes. On his arrival, the h&ocirc;tel that
had belonged to Montagu was given to him,
with all its furniture, for it had been confiscated
to the king’s use; and duke William took instant
possession.</p>

<p>The castle of Marcoussi, which had been
built by Montagu, was seized by the king: it is
situated seven leagues from Paris, on the road
to Chartres. Montagu was born in Paris, and
had first been secretary to the king: he was the
son of Gerard de Montagu, who had also been
secretary to Charles V. He was of noble birth
by his mother’s side, and had three daughters,
two of whom were married; the elder to John<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
count de Roussy, the second to Peter de Craon,
lord of Montbason; and the third was betrothed
to John de Melun, son to the lord d’Antoing<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>,
but the match was broken off: his son was
married to the daughter of the lord d’Albret,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
constable of France and cousin to the king, as
has been related.</p>

<p>After this, the provost of Paris arrested
many of the king’s officers, particularly those
who had been concerned in the finances and in
matters of revenue. All the principals in the
department of the generalities, the presidents
and others of the chamber of accounts, Perrin
Pillot, a merchant, with several others, were
imprisoned in the Louvre and in other places
of confinement.</p>

<p>When the borgne de Foucal, equerry to
the king, and keeper of that department of
the treasury called the Epargne, heard that
the grand master of the household was
arrested, he was greatly astonished and
troubled, and, instantly changing his dress,
mounted a fleet horse, and secretly left Paris.
This caused him to be much suspected of
improper conduct by the princes who were
examining into these matters.</p>

<p>At this period, the archbishop of Sens,
brother to the grand master, Guichart Daulphin,
William de Tignonville, knights, and master
Goutier Col, secretary to the king, were sent,
by orders from the king, to meet the english
ambassadors at Amiens. The archbishop,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
hearing of the arrest and imprisonment of his
brother, took leave of his companions, and set
out from Amiens: but as he was journeying
toward Paris, he was met by one of the king’s
ushers, who made him his prisoner; for he had
orders so to do from the king, and confine him
at Amiens, should he chance to find him there.</p>

<p>The archbishop very prudently replied,
that he was ready to follow him to prison or
to death; but when they came to the river
Oise, near the priory of St Leu de Cherens, he
played the usher a trick. On leaving the ferry
boat with a few of his people, he mounted the
fleetest of his horses, and galloped off, leaving
the usher on the other side waiting for the
return of the ferry-boat; but, thunderstruck
at his being so cheated, he returned to Paris
without his prisoner.</p>

<p>The lord de Tignonville, having been a
member of the chamber of accounts, was, by
command of the princes, arrested by the bailiff
of Amiens, and confined in his prison. But
after a short time, he, the bishop of Chartres,
and the other prisoners at Paris, were suspended
from their offices, and, having given bail, were
permitted to go about Paris, or wherever they
pleased.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>The princes, not being able to attend
sufficiently to these matters of reform from
their other occupations of greater weight,
appointed a commission to examine carefully
into them, which commission was composed
of the counts de la Marche, de Vend&ocirc;me
and de St Pol, with some members of the
parliament.</p>

<p>The men at arms that had been called
together round Paris by the duke of Burgundy
and others were disbanded; and each, as they
returned to the places whence they had come,
devoured the substance of the poor people,
according to the custom of that time.</p>

<p>Sir Guichart Daulphin<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>, before mentioned,
was, by the princes, appointed grand master of
the king’s household in the room of the
murdered Montagu; for the king was then
troubled with his usual disorder.</p>

<p>The bishop of Paris now requested of the
princes, that they would, in their mercy, permit
him to have the body of his brother taken
down from the gibbet, and, with many tears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
and supplications, petitioned for leave to
bury him. But neither of these requests was
granted him by the princes; on which the
bishop, ashamed of the disgraceful death of
one brother and the flight of another, the
archbishop of Sens, soon after quitted his
see, and taking with him his sister-in-law,
the widow of Montagu, and some of their
children, for the duke of Berry had already
appointed another chancellor, went to the
estate of his sister-in-law in Savoy: she was
the daughter of sir Stephen de la Grange,
formerly president of the parliament, and
brother to the cardinal d’Amiens.</p>

<p>The borgne de Foucal, not answering
to the proclamations that were made for his
appearance, was banished the realm of France,
by sound of trumpet in the four quarters of
Paris. In like manner were the archbishop of
Sens and many other fugitives banished the
kingdom.</p>

<p>The king of Navarre, the dukes of Berry,
Burgundy and Holland, with the counts de
Vend&ocirc;me and de la Marche, and several great
lords, waited on the queen of France and the
duke of Acquitaine, to make them acquainted
with the reasons for the executing Montagu,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and what progress they had made in the
reformation of abuses, and the measures they
had pursued against such as were criminal.
The queen testified her satisfaction, and was
contented that they should proceed as they had
began. She was, however, far from being
pleased with the duke of Burgundy, whom
she dreaded, from the great power he was
now possessed of, more than any of the other
princes, although he treated her respectfully
in his speech.</p>

<p>The marriage of the lord Louis of Bavaria,
brother to the queen, was again talked of with
the daughter of the king of Navarre; and he
was presented with the castle of Marcoussi,
with all its furniture and appurtenances, which
had lately been confiscated to the king, by the
death of Montagu, which was very agreeable
to the queen.</p>

<p>After these lords had for some days
transacted business at Melun, where the court
was, they all returned to Paris, carrying with
them master Peter Bosthet, president of the
parliament, and some members of the chamber
of accounts, and assembled daily to inquire
after those persons who had been in the receipt
and expenditure of the public revenues.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>During this time, the king, who had been
very ill, was restored to health, insomuch that
on the 2d day of December, he rode from his
palace of St Pol, dressed in a hauberk under
his robes, to the cathedral church of N&ocirc;tre
Dame, where he made his prayers, a page
carrying behind him a very handsome steel
helmet and a moorish lance. Having finished
his prayers, he returned to his palace of Saint
Pol.</p>

<p>On the morrow, he held a royal council
in person, at which were present the king of
Navarre, the dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and
of Bourbon, which last was lately returned to
Paris. It was there resolved, that the king
should summon the following lords to attend
him personally at the ensuing feast of Christmas,
namely, the dukes of Orleans, of Brittany, of
Brabant, of Bar, and of Lorraine: the counts
of Savoy<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>, of Alen&ccedil;on, of Penthievre, of
Namur, of Harcourt, of Armagnac<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
general all the great lords within his realm of
France and Dauphiny, with many prelates and
other noblemen. After this summons of the
king, the duke of Burgundy gave orders for a
large body of men at arms to be collected in
his countries of Flanders, Artois and Burgundy,
for the safety of his person.</p>

<p>Shortly after this council, duke William
count of Hainault went to Melun, the residence
of the queen of France, who was his near
relation; and so managed that she, who could
not bear the duke of Burgundy, and had
strongly supported the party adverse to him,
namely, that of my lord the duke of Orleans,
was reconciled to him.

NAMES OF THE LORDS WHO CAME TO
PARIS IN OBEDIENCE TO THE KING’S
ORDERS.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">About</span> this time, duke Louis of Bavaria was
married at Melun to the daughter of the king
of Navarre, according to what has been before
mentioned. She had previously married the
eldest son of the king of Arragon<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>, who had
lately been slain in a battle between him and
the viscount de Narbonne and the Sardinians,
which took place in Sardinia. There was
much feasting at this wedding, which was
attended by many lords, ladies and damsels.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<p>About Christmas the greater part of those
lords whom the king had summoned, arrived
at Paris: the duke of Orleans and his brothers,
however, did not come. On the eve of
Christmas-day, the king went to the palace
to hold his state, and remained there until
St Thomas’s day, where he celebrated most
solemnly the feast of the nativity of our
Lord.</p>

<p>On this day the following persons were
seated at the king’s table at dinner: on his
right, doctor William Bouratier, archbishop of
Bourges, who had said the mass, next to him
was the cardinal de Bar. The king was seated
at the middle of the table, very magnificently
dressed in his royal robes. On his left were
the dukes of Berry and Burgundy. A great
variety of ornamental plate was produced in
gold and silver, which were wont to be served
before the king on high feasts, but which had
not for some time been seen, because they had
been pawned to Montagu, and had been found
after his death in his castle of Marcoussi, and
in other places where he had hidden them.</p>

<p>By orders from the princes of the blood
they had been replaced, as usual, in the king’s
palace, which was a very agreeable sight to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
nobles and people of Paris, from their regard
to the honour of the king’s person, and his
royal state.</p>

<p>A great many princes and others had
obeyed the king’s summons, and were at this
feast,&mdash;namely, the king of Navarre, the
dukes of Berry, Burgundy, Bourbon, Brabant,
duke William count of Hainault, the duke of
Lorraine, duke Louis of Bavaria, brother to the
queen,&mdash;and nineteen counts, namely, the count
de Mortain, brother to the king of Navarre, the
count de Nevers, the count de Clermont, the
marquis du Pont, son to the duke of Bar, the
count de Vaudemont, the count d’Alen&ccedil;on, the
count de Vend&ocirc;me, the count de Penthievre,
the count de St Pol, the count de Cleves, the
count de Tancarville, the count d’Angy<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>, the
count de Namur, and several others, to the
aforesaid amount. The number of knights
who accompanied these princes was so great
that, from the report of the heralds, they were
more than eighteen hundred knights, without
including esquires.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, there were not in this noble
company the duke of Orleans nor his brothers,
nor the duke of Brittany, nor the lord d’Albret,
constable of France, nor the counts de Foix,
d’Armagnac, and many other potent lords,
although they had been summoned by the
king in like manner as the others.</p>

<p>On St Thomas’s day, after the king had
feasted his nobles in royal state, the queen, by
orders from the king, came from the castle of
Vincennes to Paris. All the princes, prelates,
and great crowds of people, went out to meet
her and her son, the duke of Acquitaine, and
conducted her to the palace, where they
presented her to the king, in the presence of
all the before-mentioned lords. Her son had
visited his government, to be properly instructed
in arms, and other necessary matters, that he
might be the better qualified to rule his kingdom
when it should fall to him.

<p class="hang">THE KING OF FRANCE KEEPS ROYAL STATE IN
HIS PALACE, WHEREIN SEVERAL OF THE
GREAT LORDS BEFORE MENTIONED HOLD
MANY COUNCILS ON THE STATE OF THE
NATION.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> consequence of several meetings having
been held in the presence of the king, queen,
and duke of Acquitaine, the king ordered the
great hall of the palace to be magnificently
prepared for a royal sessions. Thither were
summoned all the principal noblemen, prelates
and others, when the king appeared seated in
his regal robes. On one side of him were the
king of Navarre and the cardinal de Bar, and
on the other the duke of Acquitaine, the duke
of Berry, and all the other princes and nobles,
each seated according to his rank: in like
manner were the prelates, knights, and clergy,
and a multitude of others, seated according to
their respective situations in life.</p>

<p>Then, by the king’s commands, the count
de Tancarville, an able and eloquent man,
harangued with a loud and clear voice, how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Richard late king of England, and son-in-law
to the king, had been basely and treacherously
put to death, during the time of a truce, by
Henry of Lancaster, calling himself king of
England, but then earl of Derby, in conjunction
with his partisans, as might be fully proved by
several of the English, near relations of the
deceased king Richard:&mdash;And also how the
young prince of Scotland, an ally to the king,
when on his voyage to France, was taken by
this same Henry, and detained his prisoner for
a long time; as were likewise many Scots, who
were in the company of the prince of Wales.
Yvain Graindos<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>, with several of his Welshmen,
allies also to the king, notwithstanding the
aforesaid truce, were by the English harrassed
with war. The eldest son likewise to the
prince of Wales was made captive<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>, carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
to England, and imprisoned by Henry for a
considerable time.</p>

<p>‘In consequence of the facts above stated,
the king thinks he may, without further
consideration, lawfully wage war against the
said Henry and his english subjects, without
giving them any respite. Notwithstanding
this,’ continued the orator, ‘the king is
desirous that whatever he may please to
order should be for the common welfare of
the state; and for this purpose a royal sessions
has been held, for every one to consider these
matters and what ought to be the line of
conduct for him to pursue,&mdash;and, having an
opinion thereon, if they will inform the king
or his council thereof, the king will thank
them and follow that advice which shall seem
to him the most advantageous for the general
good.</p>

<p>Upon this, the eldest of the princes of the
blood, namely, the king’s uncle the duke of
Berry, arose from his seat, and, advancing in
front of the king’s throne, fell on his knees,
and, speaking for himself and the other
princes of the blood, declared they would
relinquish, to the use of the state, all taxes
and impositions which they annually levied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
on their lands,&mdash;and in like manner would
they relinquish all the fees and perquisites of
office which they were in the habit of receiving
from their places under the king, and as the
members of his council.</p>

<p>The king kindly listened to the duke’s
speech, and accepted his offers, and then
commanded him to be reseated. The lord
Tancarville continued his harangue, saying,
that the king, then present, revoked all
pensions and grants which he had given,
and thus publicly annulled them. In regard
to the reformation and future management of
the finances, the king declared his intention
that such regulations as should be ordered by
himself, and by the advice of the count de
la Marche (who had now lost his wife, the
daughter of the king of Navarre), his brother
the count de Vend&ocirc;me, the count de Saint
Pol, and the other commissioners from the
parliament, should be fully executed without
excepting any person whatever; and that the
reformations by them proposed should take
place, as well in the chambers of accounts as
in the generalities and in the household of the
king,&mdash;and that all receivers, comptrollers,
and all persons any way interested in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
management of the finances of the realm,
whether bishops or archbishops, and of what
rank soever, should be subjected to them.’
The orator continued,&mdash;‘That the king
willed and ordered, that during his absence,
the queen should call to her assistance some
of the princes of the royal blood, and should
govern the affairs of this kingdom according
as she might judge most conducive to its
welfare; and in case of the absence of the
queen, the duke of Acquitaine, his son, then
present, should govern the kingdom, with
the assistance of the dukes of Berry and
Burgundy.’</p>

<p>When the lord de Tancarville had more
fully enlarged on the above matters, and
concluded his speech, the king descended
from his royal throne, and, with a small
company, entered his apartment to dinner; and
the whole assembly broke up, and departed
to their h&ocirc;tels.</p>

<p>After the dinner, the queen set out with
her attendants for the castle of Vincennes, as
it was the eve of the feast of the Circumcision,
but left her son with the king. On the
morrow, the feast-day, the duke of Burgundy
(who had alone more princes, knights, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
gentlemen attached to him than all the other
princes together,) gave presents of jewels and
rich gifts, of greater magnificence than any
one, according to the custom of that day.
He made presents to all the knights and
nobles of his household, to the amount, as
was estimated, of fifteen thousand golden
florins, of medals formed like to a mason’s
level, of gold and silver gilt; and at the
pointed ends of these levels was fastened a
small gilt chain, with a plummet of gold, so
that it might be used as a rule.</p>

<p>Item, on Twelfth-day following, Louis
king of Sicily, having been sent for by the
king, entered Paris. He came from the city
of Pisa, whither he had gone to visit pope
Alexander V. and made his entry, attended
by numbers of the nobility and clergy, who
had gone out to meet him.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the cardinal de Thurey
came to Paris, as ambassador from the pope
to the king, who most honourably received
him, as he likewise did Philibert de Lignac,
grand master of Rhodes, and chief of the
order of St John of Jerusalem, who had
come from England.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>The king now disbanded all the troops he
had collected, as did the duke of Burgundy,
excepting about one hundred or six score
gentlemen, whom he retained, with those of
his household, to guard his person: the others
returned to their homes.</p>

<p>Before the duke of Burgundy left Paris,
the duke of Acquitaine, with the consent of
the king and queen, was intrusted to his care
and guardianship, that he might be properly
instructed in the arts of war and government.
He had been very anxious to obtain this, and
had caused several of the princes of the blood
to press the matter: even his uncle, the duke
of Berry, had, on this account, more than
once refused the queen to accept of the
guardianship of the duke of Acquitaine; but
had so urged the business that the lord de
Dolhaing<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>, knight, his principal esquire,
counsellor and advocate, had, by the earnest
desire of the queen, been made chancellor to
the duke of Acquitaine, and the lord de Saint
George his first chamberlain. The government
of the castles of Crotoy and Beaurain-sur-Canche
were granted to the duke of Berry for his life,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
on giving the preceding governors the usual
pension, in whose room he appointed two of
his own knights; the lord de Croy to Crotoy,
and the lord de Humbercourt to Beaurain;
and sir Reginald Pot was, at his request,
appointed governor of Dauphiny for the
dauphin. Soon after this, the king relapsed
into his usual disorder, and was put under
good guard. Those who were intrusted with
the reform of abuses continued daily at work,
and with such success that large sums were
recovered from the late directors of the
finances.</p>

<p>At this period, the princes and council of
state went often to the castle of Vincennes,
where the queen resided,&mdash;for without her
knowledge no business of any importance was
carried on. The dukes of Berry and Bourbon,
however, were much discontented that they
were not so often summoned to the council as
before, and that their authority was greatly
lessened. Seeing themselves, as it were, banished
from the government, they took leave of the
king, queen, and princes, and each retired to
his own domains.</p>

<p>The cardinal de Thurey had come to
Paris to solicit the university and council of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
state to consent that pope Alexander might
levy two-tenths on the gallican church, to
defray the great expenses he was bound to
pay. This request was not granted, because
the university opposed it, in the name of the
whole church. The better to effect this, the
university required and obtained a royal
mandate, to command all officers under the
crown forcibly to send out of their jurisdictions
all persons who should come thither making
similar demands. The solicitors of this levy
had brought to Paris with them a bull
containing many novelties, which were not
usually advanced, namely, that the tythes, and
other things, such as oblations to the church,
belonged to them in preference to the parochial
clergy, for that in fact they were in the same
capacity, inasmuch as whoever should confess
themselves to them were not under the necessity
of so doing to their own clergyman. This
doctrine they publicly preached throughout
Paris, and the members of the university
preached in opposition to it, so that during
Lent the whole town was in confusion and
discord by these quarrels of the university and
the mendicants, until they were driven out of
it by the university. The Jacobins, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
as the most prudent, renounced the bull, and
made oath that they would never claim any
advantages from it, nor from other privileges
that had been granted to them. By this
means, they were reconciled to the university.
The pope, at this period, held his court with
great state in Bologna la Grassa.</p>

BETWEEN THE KING OF POLAND, ON THE
ONE HAND, AND THE GRAND MASTER OF
PRUSSIA AND HIS KNIGHTS ON THE OTHER.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">This</span> year, a great quarrel arose between the
king of Poland and the grand master of the
Teutonic order in Prussia; and the king
assembled a large force from different nations,
which he marched into Prussia, with the intent
to destroy it.</p>

<p>The grand master and his brethren soon
made themselves ready to meet him with a
great army, and showed every inclination to
give him battle; but when the two armies
were in sight of each other, through the will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
of God, the king of Poland retreated with his
forces, among which were twenty thousand
Tartars at least, without counting his Polanders
and others his Christian allies, who were very
numerous, and returned to his own country.</p>

<p>Afterward, the king of Lithuania, by the
exhortations of the king of Poland, invaded
Prussia with an immense army, and destroyed
the greater part which lay on the sea-shores.
The Prussians made a thousand of them
prisoners, and slew many.</p>

<p>The king of Poland was formerly an
infidel, and son to the king of Lithuania, but,
having a great ambition to reign, murdered his
father, and was for this crime banished the
country. He took refuge with the then king
of Poland, who received him kindly, and
admitted him into his friendship and confidence.
He also gained the affections of the princes and
nobles, insomuch that, on the death of their
king, they unanimously elected this parricide
to succeed him, had him baptised, and married
him to the widow of the late king; and, since
that time, he has happily enough governed
that kingdom<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<p>At this period, Sigismond king of

took to wife the sister of the above queen of
Poland: they were daughters to a german
count, called the count de Cilly, of the royal
branch of Hungary<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>. The king of Poland
laid claim to Hungary in right of his wife,
and thence took occasion to harrass that
country as well as Prussia. He sent secret
messengers to the king of Lithuania, his cousin
german and ally, to press him to invade Prussia
on the quarter nearest the sea, when he would
march his Polanders to form a junction and
destroy the whole of it. His intentions were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
discovered by the messenger being arrested by
orders of the king of Hungary, and information
sent of them to Prussia, whenceforward the
king of Hungary and grand master took such
wise precautions that his future attempts were
fruitless.</p>

MARRIAGE OF THE SON OF THE KING
OF SICILY.&mdash;THE ASSEMBLY THAT IS
HOLDEN AT MEUN LE CHASTEL.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">This</span> year, the duke of Berry was, by the
king’s orders, remanded to Paris, and, on his
arrival, was sent, with the king of Navarre, to
Giens sur Loire, to put an end to the quarrels
between the duke of Brittany and the count
and countess of Penthievre. Although both
parties had promised to meet them, they did
not personally attend, but sent commissioners.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>The king of Navarre and the duke of
Berry took great pains, and proposed various
means, to bring about a reconciliation. Finding
all their attempts fruitless, they referred the whole
matter, with the consent of the commissioners,
to the king’s decision on All-saints-day next
coming, and then they returned to Paris.</p>

<p>In this year was concluded the marriage
between the eldest son of Louis king of Sicily,
and Catherine, daughter to the duke of
Burgundy. The lady was conducted by sir
John de Ch&acirc;lons, lord de Darlay, the lord de
St George, sir William de Champdivers, and
sir James de Courtjambe, to Angers, and there
delivered to the queen of Sicily, who received
her most affectionately and honourably,&mdash;and
she magnificently entertained the knights who
had brought her. After a short stay at Angers,
they returned to their lord, the duke of
Burgundy, at Paris.</p>

<p>At this time, the dukes of Orleans and
Bourbon, the counts de Clermont, d’Alen&ccedil;on,
d’Armagnac, the lord Charles d’Albreth,
constable, and many other lords of great
power and authority, held a meeting in the
town of Meun le Ch&acirc;tel,&mdash;where they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
several long consultations with each other on
the state of public affairs, and particularly as
to the murder of the late duke of Orleans,
principally to consider how they should
proceed to take vengeance on the person
who had committed it. Many different
opinions were urged: one was, that the
duke of Orleans should declare a deadly war
against him, and carry it on by every possible
means, with the assistance of his relations,
friends, and the wellwishers to his cause.</p>

<p>Others said, it would be better to follow
another course, and remonstrate strongly to
the king, their sovereign lord, on the necessity
he was under to do strict justice on the duke
of Burgundy, to which he was the more
particularly bound, as the murder was
committed on his own brother. But, as
they could not all agree in the same opinion,
they broke up the meeting, and appointed
another day to assemble again.</p>

<p>Before they separated, a treaty of
marriage was entered upon between Charles
duke of Orleans and the daughter of the
count d’Armagnac. She was niece to the
duke of Berry by her mother’s side, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
sister<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> to the count de Savoye. This done,
the lords departed for their own domains.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy resided in Paris,
and ruled there more despotically than any
other of the princes: affairs were solely
carried on by him and his partisans, which,
no doubt, made very many jealous of him.</p>

<p class="hang">THE KING OF SICILY GOES TO PROVENCE
AND TO BOLOGNA, TO MEET HIS RIVAL
KING LADISLAUS.&mdash;THE DEATH OF POPE
ALEXANDER, AND THE ELECTION OF POPE
JOHN.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">About</span> this period, Louis king of Sicily set
out from Paris with a numerous body of men
at arms, and went for Provence, and thence to
Bologna, to meet king Ladislaus, his opponent,
and to defend his kingdom of Naples, where his
rival was committing great devastation. King
Louis had for this raised so considerable a force,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
that he might be enabled to offer him combat;
and he had also the hope that pope Alexander
would assist him, to the utmost of his ability,
in money and in men.</p>

<p>An end was soon put to his expectations
in this respect; for, on the morrow of the feast of
the discovery of the holy cross, pope Alexander
was poisoned in the town of Bologna, as was
currently reported, and died most pitifully.
His bowels were interred, and his obsequies
were performed in the church of the Cordeliers.
Mass was celebrated by the cardinal de Vimers:
the deacon and under deacon were the cardinals
d’Espaigne and de Thurey. The whole court
was dressed in deep mourning.</p>

<p>The 6th of May, the corpse of the pope,
having been embalmed with fine spices, was
placed in the hall of audience, dressed in his
papal robes, his face uncovered, gloves on his
hands, but his feet naked, so that whoever
pleased might kiss them,&mdash;and nine funeral
services were there performed.</p>

<p>There were present twenty cardinals,
two patriarchs, four archbishops, twenty-four
bishops, with many prelates, abbots, and other
churchmen. His escutcheon of arms were
placed at the four corners of his coffin; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
for nine days, masses were celebrated in the
same manner as on the morrow of his death.
The masses were said by the cardinals in
rotation; and the ninth day, the body was
carried to the Cordeliers for interment.</p>

<p>The two first bearers were the cardinals de
Vimers and de Challant, and the two last the
cardinals d’Espaigne and de Thurey. The
cardinal Milles preceded the body bearing a
cross. The chorists were the cardinals de
Bar, (not the son of the duke of Bar, but
the cardinal of Bar<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> in Calabria), and
d’Orsini. The cardinal de Vimers performed
the service, as he had done at the interment of
the bowels.</p>

<p>When this ceremony was over, the
cardinals returned home dressed in black;
and after dinner, they assembled at the
palace, and entered into conclave, where
they remained shut up from the Wednesday
to the Saturday following. Some of the
cardinals, having consulted together, proposed
Balthazar, cardinal of Bologna, as sovereign
pontiff of the universal church; and the
others, who were not of this opinion, seeing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
their numbers were very small, consented to
it; and the new pope was conducted by them
to the church of St Peter, where they placed
the tiara on his head, and took the oaths of
fidelity to him. They then led him to the
palace of his predecessor, where every piece of
furniture had been carried off, and there did
not remain even a door or window-frame.</p>

<p>On the morrow, he took the name of
pope John XXIII. and great were the
rejoicings and feasts that ensued. In the
procession were twenty-three cardinals, two
patriarchs, three archbishops, twenty-seven
abbots, mitred and non-mitred, without
reckoning other churchmen, who were
almost numberless. The pope wore on
that day a silver-gilt tiara bound with white.
The following Saturday, the 23d of May,
the pope received, in the chapel of his
predecessors, the holy order of priesthood,
when the cardinal de Vimers said the mass,
and the cardinal de Challant was deacon: at
this service, all the before-named prelates
attended.</p>

<p>On the following day, Sunday, the pope
celebrated mass in the church of St Peter,
having the cardinal de Vimers near him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
show him the service. The marquis of Ferrara
and the lord of Malatesta were present, and
held the bason wherein the pope washed his
hands. The marquis of Ferrara had brought
with him fifty-four knights, all clothed in
scarlet and blue, having five trumpets and
four companies of minstrels, each playing on
a different instrument.</p>

<p>When mass was finished, pope John was
carried out of the church to a very handsome
platform erected without the porch, and there
solemnly crowned in the presence of all those
whom I have mentioned, and a great multitude
of doctors and clergy.</p>

<p>When seated on his throne, which was
covered all over with cloth of gold, he was
surrounded by the cardinals de Vimers, de
Challant, de Milles, d’Espaigne, de Thurey,
and de Bar, having tufts of tow in their hands.
The cardinals lighted their tufts; and as the
flame was suddenly extinguished, they addressed
the pope, saying, ‘Thus, holy father, passes
the glory of this world!’ This was done
three times.</p>

<p>The cardinal de Vimers having said some
prayers over him and on the crown, placed it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
upon his head. This crown was a triple one:
the first of gold, which encircled the forehead
within the mitre; the second of gold and silver,
about the middle of the mitre; and the third,
of very fine gold, surmounted it. He was then
led down from the platform, and placed on a
horse covered over with scarlet furniture. The
horses of the cardinals and bishops, &amp;c. were
caparisoned in white; and in this state he was
conducted from street to street, making every
where the sign of the cross, until he came to
where the Jews resided, who presented him
with a manuscript of the Old Testament.
He took it with his own hand, and, having
examined it a little, threw it behind him,
saying, ‘Your religion is good, but this of
ours is better.’</p>

<p>As he departed, the Jews followed him,
intending to touch him,&mdash;in the attempt of
which, the caparison of his horse was all torn.&mdash;Wherever
he passed, the pope distributed
money,&mdash;that is to say, quadrini and mailles
of Florence, with other coins. There were
before and behind him two hundred men at
arms, each having in his hand a leathern
mallet, with which they struck the Jews in
such wise as it was a pleasure to see.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>On the morrow, he returned to his
palace, accompanied by the cardinals dressed
in crimson,&mdash;the patriarchs in like manner,&mdash;the
archbishops and bishops in similar dresses,
having white mitres on their heads, and
numbers of mitred and non-mitred abbots.
In this procession were, the marquis of
Ferrara<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>, the lord Malatesta<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>, the lord of
Gaucourt<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>, and others, to the amount of
forty-four, as well dukes as counts and
knights of Italy, all dressed out in their
liveries. In each street, two and two by
turns led the pope’s horse by the bridle,&mdash;the
one on the right hand, and another on
the left.</p>

<p>There were thirty-six bagpipes and
trumpets, and ten bands of minstrels playing
on musical instruments, each band consisting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
of three performers. There were also singers,
especially those of the chapel of his predecessor,
as well as those belonging to the cardinals and
from different parts of Italy, who rode before
the pope loudly chaunting various airs, sacred
and profane.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the palace, he gave
his peace to all the cardinals, who, according
to their rank in the college, kissed his foot,
hand, or mouth. The cardinal de Vimers first
performed the ceremony, and was followed
by the other cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops,
bishops, abbots and clergy. He then gave his
benediction to the four elements, and to all
persons in a state of grace, as well to those
absent as present, and bestowed his dispensations
for four months to come, provided that, during
this time, three Pater-nosters should be said
by each in praying for his predecessor, pope
Alexander.</p>

<p>Pope John then went to dinner, as it was
now about twelve o’clock, and this ceremony
had commenced between five and six in the
morning.</p>

<p>In honour of him, feasts were continued
at Bologna for the space of eight days; and
on each of them very handsome processions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
were made round St Peter’s church, when the
prelates were all dressed in vermilion robes,
with copes of the same. In like manner did
the Carthusians of St Michael’s Mount, without
the walls of Bologna.</p>

<p>The next day, the 25th of May, pope
John held a consistory, in the presence of the
cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and
presented to the marquis of Ferrara and the
italian heralds, many and various rich gifts.
This was followed by a great feast, with
dancing and music. The ensuing day, the
pope revoked all that his predecessor had
done, excepting what he had confirmed, or
what had been taken corporal or spiritual
possession of.</p>

<p>King Louis of Sicily arrived at Bologna
the Friday after the coronation of the pope,
and twenty-two cardinals, two patriarchs, six
archbishops, twenty bishops and eighteen
abbots, handsomely equipped, went out of the
city to meet him: on his entrance, he went
directly to the pope. He was clothed in scarlet,
and his horse’s furniture was ornamented with
small gilt bells: he was attended by about
fifty knights dressed in his uniform. It was
the last day of May that the king arrived,&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
he was most graciously received by the
pope.</p>

<p>The ensuing day, the Florentines came
to pay their duty and reverence to the holy
father. They were about three hundred horse,
among whom were eighteen knights dressed in
scarlet, with feathers bespangled with gold.
They were attended by six trumpets, two
heralds, and ten musicians playing on different
instruments. When they had made their
reverence to the pope, they returned to their
h&ocirc;tels, and the next day went to court. By
reason of their alliance with king Louis, they
supplicated the pope to give him assistance
against his adversary king Ladislaus, adding,
that they intended affording him every aid
in their power of men and money. These
Florentines were very indignant at the late
conduct of the Genoese in regard to the king
of Sicily; for when the king of Sicily was
sailing with five gallies from Marseilles, near
to the port of Genoa, the Genoese, being in
the interest of king Ladislaus, hastily armed
fifteen gallies with cross-bows and men at arms,
and sent them to attack the remainder of king
Louis’s fleet that was following him, which
they conquered, all but one, that escaped back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
to Marseilles by superior sailing, and carried
the crews and all their baggage prisoners to
Genoa.</p>

<p>The pope, having heard their request,
asked some time to consider of it before he
gave an answer. He could not well consent
to it, because the Genoese had been long
connected with him, and he had also entered
into some engagements with king Ladislaus.
The matter was, therefore, deferred. King
Louis was, notwithstanding this, magnificently
feasted by the pope and cardinals; after
which, he left his court well pleased, and
returned to Provence.</p>

<p>On the first day of June, the pope held
an open court, and signed many graces and
benefices, and all such things as with honour
and justice he could sign. He continued from
that time to hold public audiences, and to do
whatever business appertained to the papacy.

<h2 id="CHAP_XIX">CHAP. XIX.</h2>

<p class="hang">THE GRAND MASTER OF PRUSSIA MARCHES
A POWERFUL ARMY OF CHRISTIANS INTO
LITHUANIA.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">This</span> year, 1410, the grand master of the
Teutonic order, accompanied by his brother
knights and a numerous army of three hundred
thousand Christians, invaded the kingdom of
Lithuania, to destroy the whole of it. The
king of Lithuania was soon ready to meet
him; and, aided by the king of Sarmatia, he
assembled an army of four hundred thousand
infidels, and offered battle.</p>

<p>The Christians gained a complete victory,&mdash;for
there remained dead on the field full
thirty-six thousand infidels, the principals of
whom were the grand general of Lithuania
and the constable of Sarmatia. The remnant,
with the other officers, escaped by flight. Of
the Christians, only two hundred were slain,
but a great many were wounded.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the king of Poland, who
was a determined enemy to the grand master
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
of Prussia, (and who had but faintly accepted
of Christianity in order to obtain his kingdom)
marched his Polanders to the assistance of the
infidels, whom he strongly pressed to renew
the war against Prussia, insomuch that, eight
days after this defeat, the king of Poland,
in conjunction with the aforesaid two kings,
assembled an army of six hundred thousand
men, and marched against the grand master of
Prussia, and other Christian lords. A battle
ensued, which was lost by the Christians, who
had more than sixty thousand killed and
wounded. In the number of dead were the
grand master of Prussia, with a noble knight
from Normandy, called sir John de Ferriere,
son to the lord de Ferriere, and another from
Picardy, son to the lord du Bos d’Ancquin.</p>

<p>It was currently reported that the day had
been lost through the fault of the constable of
Hungary, who commanded the second squadron
of the Christians, by running away with all his
Hungarians. The infidels, however, did not
gain the glory without loss,&mdash;for without
counting the Polanders, who had ten thousand
men slain, they lost upward of six-score thousand
men, according to the reports of the heralds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
and the bastard of Scotland, called the count
de Hembe<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>.</p>

<p>The lord de Kyeuraing and John de
Grez, Hainaulters, were there, and with them
full twenty-four gentlemen, their countrymen,
who were unhurt at this battle, and returned
home as speedily as they could.</p>

<p>After the engagement, the infidels entered
Prussia, and despoiled many parts of it, and
took twelve inclosed towns in a short time and
destroyed them. They would have persevered
in their wickedness, and have done further
mischief, had not a valiant knight of the
Teutonic order, named Charles de Mouroufle<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>,
rallied a great number of the Christians who
had fled, and by his prudence and vigour
regained the greater part of these towns, and
finally driven the infidels out of the country<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>.

<p class="hang">THE DUKE OF BERRY QUITS PARIS, AND
RETIRES TO HIS OWN ESTATES.&mdash;HE GOES
AFTERWARD TO ANGERS, AND UNITES WITH
THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND THE OTHER
PRINCES OF HIS PARTY.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke of Berry, finding that he had not
that government of the king and the duke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Acquitaine to which he had been accustomed,
became very discontented, and retired to his
estates, indignant at the ministers, and
particularly at his nephew and godson, the
duke of Burgundy. Shortly after, he went
to Angers, where the dukes of Orleans and
of Bourbon, and all the principal lords of
that party, were assembled.</p>

<p>They went in a body to the cathedral
church, and there made oath, in the most
solemn manner, to support each other, and
mutually to defend their honour against all
who should attempt any thing against it,
excepting the king, and ever to remain in
strict friendship united, without acting to the
contrary in any kind of measure.</p>

<p>Many great lords in France were not
pleased with this confederation; and when,
shortly after, news of it was brought to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
king and his council, he was much astonished
and dissatisfied therewith.</p>

<p>The king, in consequence of the advice of
the duke of Burgundy and his friends, marched
out of Paris, accompanied by him, the duke
of Brabant, the count de Montagu, and a large
body of chivalry, and went to Senlis: thence
to the town of Creil, to regain the castle of
that place, which the duke of Bourbon held,
and had given the government of it to some of
his people.</p>

<p>The governor made so many delays before
he surrendered it that the king became much
displeased; and because they had not obeyed
his first summons, the garrison were made
prisoners, and carried bound to the prisons
of the Ch&acirc;telet in Paris. The countess of
Clermont, cousin-german to the king, soon
after made application for their deliverance,
and obtained it; and on the morrow the king
appointed another garrison, and returned to
Paris.</p>

<p>This expedition was not very agreeable
to the Orleans-faction,&mdash;and they continued
to collect daily, and inlist in their party as
many as they could.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy became very
uneasy at their proceedings; for he suspected
the duke of Orleans and his party would
infringe the peace which had so lately been
patched up between them at Chartres, or that
they would march a large force to Paris, to
seize the government, together with the persons
of the king and duke of Acquitaine.</p>

<p>To obviate this, he caused several royal
summons to be proclaimed in various parts of
the realm, for the assembling of men at arms
and quartering them in the villages round
Paris, to be ready to defend the king and his
government against the ill-intentioned. By
the advice of his brothers and the king of
Navarre, he resolved to defend himself by
force against his adversaries, and caused it to
be proclaimed throughout the kingdom, in
the king’s name, that no one should dare to
assemble armed in company of the dukes of
Berry and Orleans, and their allies, under
pain of corporal punishment and confiscation
of goods.</p>

<p>The Orleans-faction, however, continued
their meetings in spite of this proclamation,
and even forced their vassals to serve under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
and accompany them: I mean, such of them
as were dilatory in obeying their summons.
There were, therefore, at this time, great
and frequent assemblies of armed men in
different parts of France, to the prejudice of
the poor people.</p>

<p>Those lords that were well inclined to
the king came to Paris, and their men were
quartered in the flat country of the island of
France. The Orleans-party fixed their quarters
at Chartres and the adjacent parts; and their
forces might amount, according to the estimate
of well-informed persons, to full six thousand
men in armour, four thousand cross-bows, and
sixteen hundred archers, without counting the
unarmed infantry, of which there were great
numbers.</p>

<p>In regard to the army which the duke of
Burgundy had assembled by orders from the
king, it was estimated to consist of upward of
sixteen thousand combatants, all men of tried
courage. During this time, the king of Navarre
and his brother, the count de Mortain, at the
request of the duke of Burgundy, negotiated
a peace between the duke of Brittany, their
nephew, and the count de Penthievre,
son-in-law to the duke of Burgundy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>This was done in the hope that the duke
of Brittany would be induced to assist the king
with his Bretons, and give up the Orleans-party,
to whom he had engaged himself. On the
conclusion of this peace between the two parties,
twenty thousand golden crowns were sent the
duke, to defray the expenses he had been at in
raising men at arms.</p>

<p>Large sums of money were also sent to
the lord d’Albreth, constable of France, that
he might collect a numerous body of men at
arms, and march them to Paris, to serve the
king. He had not any great desire to perform
this, for he was wholly inclined to the duke of
Orleans and his allies, as was perfectly notorious
shortly afterward.</p>

<p class="hang">THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BOURBON.&mdash;THE
PROCLAMATION OF THE KING OF FRANCE.&mdash;THE
DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS ALLIES
SEND LETTERS TO THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS
IN FRANCE.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> this troublesome time, Louis duke of
Bourbon, uncle to the king of France by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
mother’s side, being full sixty years of age,
feeling himself oppressed with years and
sickness, caused himself to be conveyed to
his residence at Moulins<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> in the Bourbonnois,
where he departed this life, and was buried
in the church of the canons, which he had
founded.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his only son, the
count de Clermont, who, after some days of
lamentation, had the funeral obsequies of his
father performed, and, having arranged his
affairs, returned to the duke of Orleans and
the other lords at Chartres, and firmly united
himself with them, treading in the steps of
his late father. The duke of Bourbon had
long held the office of great chamberlain of
France, from the friendship of the king, and
was in possession of it even at the time of his
death; but at the entreaty of the king of
Navarre and the duke of Burgundy, the king
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
now gave it to the count de Nevers, to exercise
the duties of it in the usual manner.</p>

<p>At this time, the duchess of Brittany,
daughter to the king of France, was brought
to bed of a son; and she sent to request the
duke of Acquitaine, her brother, to stand
godfather. He sent, as his proxy, sir David
de Brimeu, knight, lord of Humbercourt,
with a handsome present of jewels, which
sir David gave her on the part of the duke
of Acquitaine.</p>

<p>The king again issued his summons to
the different bailiwicks and seneschalships in
the realm, for all persons to arm without
delay who were bounden so to do from the
tenure of their fiefs or arriere fiefs, and to
march instantly to Paris to serve the king
against the dukes of Orleans, Berry, Bourbon,
the counts d’Armagnac, d’Alen&ccedil;on, and others
their allies, who, notwithstanding the king’s
positive orders to the contrary, continued daily
to assemble large bodies of men at arms, to the
destruction of his country and subjects.</p>

<p>The above dukes wrote letters to the king,
to the university of Paris, and to many of the
principal towns, to explain the causes why
they had thus confederated and collected men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
at arms; one of which, signed with their
signs-manuel, they sent to the town of Amiens,
and the contents were as follows:</p>

<p>‘To our well-beloved and very dear
citizens, burgesses, and inhabitants of the
town of Amiens, health and affection. We
have written to our most redoubted and
sovereign lord the king of France in manner
following:&mdash;We dukes of Berry, of Orleans,
and of Bourbon, counts of Alen&ccedil;on and of
Armagnac, your humble uncles, relations
and subjects, for ourselves and all others our
adherents, wellwishers to your person,&mdash;as the
rights of your domination, your crown and
royal majesty, have been so nobly instituted,
and founded on justice, power, and the true
obedience of your subjects,&mdash;and as your glory
and authority are resplendent through all
parts of the world, you having been worthily
consecrated and anointed by the holy roman
see, and considered by all Christendom as
sovereign monarch and equal distributor of
justice, as well to the poor as to the rich,
without owing obedience to any other lord,
but God and his Divine Majesty, who has been
pleased most worthily to have gifted you,&mdash;may
all those who are connected with you by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
blood, by their frank and loyal affections,
guard and defend your sacred person as your
relations and subjects.</p>

<p>‘And may we, in particular, as your
near relations, and for that cause more obliged
to it, set an example of due obedience to your
other subjects, and exert ourselves in preserving
to you free liberty of action in every part of
your government, insomuch that you may
have power to reward the good and punish
the wicked, and to preserve every one in his
just rights, and likewise that you may execute
justice in such wise that your kingdom may
remain in peace, first to the honour of God,
and then to your own honour, and to the
example of your good friends and subjects, by
following the paths of your predecessors, the
kings of France, who, by this noble way of
governing their great kingdom, have ever
preserved tranquillity and peace, insomuch
that all Christian nations, far and near, and
even infidels, have had recourse to them in their
disputes, and have been perfectly contented with
their decisions on the cases referred to them, as
the fountains of justice and loyalty.</p>

<p>‘And, most sovereign lord, that your
power, justice, and the state of your government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
may not suffer at present any wound or
diminution, and that public affairs may be
managed according to the principles of reason,
in such wise as may be apparent to all men of
sound understanding;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘For this effect, most redoubted sovereign,
we, the above-written, have confederated and
assembled, that we may most humbly lay before
you the real state of your situation, in regard to
your royal person, and also that of my lord of
Acquitaine, your eldest son. We have likewise
to lay before you the manner in which you are
enthralled, and the government carried on, that
justice may be restored, and the public weal no
longer suffer, as we can more fully explain.
Should any persons deny this, let your majesty,
by the advice of your council, appoint some of
the princes of your blood, and other impartial
and unprejudiced persons, to inquire into it,
in whatever number you in your wisdom may
select. But we advise that you speedily and
effectually provide for the safety of your own
person, and for that of my lord of Acquitaine,
your eldest son, so that your state may enjoy
justice and a good government, to the
advancement of the public welfare, and that
the power and authority may be exercised by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
you alone, freely and uncontrolled by any other
person whatever; and that such a desirable
object may be obtained, we, the above-named,
offer our earnest prayers, and, at the same time,
our lives and fortunes, whatever they may be,
which God has graciously granted us in this
world, for the just defence of your rights, and
in opposing all who may attempt to infringe
on them, if any such there be.</p>

<p>‘Most redoubted lord, we also inform
you, that we shall not break up our
confederation until you shall have listened
to us, and until we shall see that you have
properly provided against the inconveniences
we have mentioned, and until you be fully
and wholly reinstated in that power which is
your right. To this, most redoubted lord, are
we bound, as well in regard to what we have
already said, as from fear, honour and reverence
to our Creator, from whom originates your
royal authority, and also to satisfy justice, and
then yourself, who are sovereign king on earth,
and our sole lord. To your support we are
urged by our kindred and by our love to your
person; for in truth, most redoubted sovereign,
there is nothing we dread so much as having
offended God, yourself, and wounded our own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
honour, by leaving for so long time unnoticed
the aforesaid grievances, which are notorious
to every one.</p>

<p>‘In like manner as we signify the above
to you, we shall do the same to all prelates,
lords, universities, cities and principal towns
of your realm, and in general to all your
wellwishers.</p>

<p>‘Most redoubted lord, we humbly
supplicate that you will deign to hear us, and
consider of what we have written,&mdash;for the
sole object we aim at personally affects yourself
and your government; and we earnestly beg
that you will speedily adopt the most effectual
measures for the enjoyment of your own freedom
of action, and that your government may be
carried on to the praise of God first, and your
own glory, and to the advantage of all your good
subjects who are anxious for your welfare.</p>

<p>‘We have written this, that you may
know our intentions, and the cause of our
assembling, which is solely for the preservation
of the personal liberty of our lord and king,
and the affranchisement of his government
from any hands but his own. For this object
we have sought the advice of the most prudent
men, and shall follow their counsels, with all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
the means God has put in our power, to obtain
so desirable an end, for the general welfare of
the realm; and we intend so to act toward
our lord the king that God and the world shall
be satisfied with us.</p>

<p>‘And we most earnestly entreat that for
so praiseworthy an object you will join us, and
exert yourselves in the same cause; for it is
not properly us but the king your lord that
you will serve, whom by your oaths you are
bounden to assist,&mdash;and know that for so
doing you will be commended by all men
of understanding and prudence. Given at
Chartres the 2d day of December, 1410.’</p>

<p>This letter, when received by the council
of the town of Amiens, produced very little
sensation,&mdash;for all, or the greater part of the
inhabitants, were inclined to the duke of
Burgundy. When a similar one was read in
the council of state, it did not make any
impression on the king, nor did it seem
advisable that the dukes should have an
audience; but, on the contrary, orders were
sent to them to disband their forces without
delay, on pain of incurring the royal indignation.&mdash;&mdash;They
refused to obey this order, and bade
the messenger tell the king, that they would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
not cease assembling until he should grant
them an audience, and hear their complaints.
At this period, the dukes of Acquitaine and
Burgundy paid a visit to the queen of France
at her residence in the castle of Melun, and
left there a garrison, having brought back
with them the queen and her children to the
castle of Vincennes.</p>

<p>The duke of Brabant at this time left
Paris, to go to his country, and assemble his
Brabanters to serve the king. Many able
ambassadors were sent, in the king’s name, to
the lords assembled at Chartres; and among
them was the grand master of Rhodes, to
signify to them that they must disband their
army, and that, if they pleased to wait on the
king in their private capacity, he would see
them.</p>

<p>This they refused; and as they continued
disobedient, the king took possession of the
counties of Boulogne<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>, Estampes, Valois,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Beaumont, Clermont, and other lands
belonging to the said dukes, counts, and
their adherents, of whatever rank they might
be. The king’s officers appointed governors
to the castles and fortresses within these
countries, whom they ordered to govern them
at the expense of the aforesaid lords.</p>

<p>So very numerous were the forces that
assembled near Paris, in obedience to the
summons from the king and the duke of
Burgundy, that the oldest persons had not
for a long time seen so many men at arms
together.</p>

<p>Among the number was the duke of
Brabant, with a great force. He was quartered
in the town of St Denis, where he lived at the
expense of the greater part of the inhabitants,
as if he had been in the open country. The
count de Penthievre, son-in-law to the duke of
Burgundy, was there with him, accompanied
by a large body of Bretons.</p>

<p>Two thousand men belonging to the
count Waleran de St Pol were quartered at
Menil-Aubry, and the adjacent villages.&mdash;Because
the count himself resided in Paris,
he one day ordered his troops to be assembled
under the lord de Chin, for him to march them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
to Paris to be mustered and enrolled for pay;
but it happened, as they were marching
through St Denis to obey the order, that a
dispute arose between them and the Brabanters,
on account of some enterprise which the last
had made against the lord de Carlian, a native
of the Boulonois, so that the two parties armed
and drew up in battle-array to decide matters
by combat. The duke of Brabant was soon
informed of this tumult, and hastened from
Paris to check his own men, and acted so
prudently with both parties that an end was
put to it; but he was very wroth with the first
promoters of it, for he was married to the
daughter and heiress of the count de St Pol.</p>

<p>When they had marched through Saint
Denis, they came before their lord, the count
de St Pol, in Paris, who having reviewed them,
and paid many compliments to their captains,
dismissed them to the quarters whence they
had come. In order to pay these troops
which had been levied, as has been said, by
orders from the king and the duke of Burgundy,
and which amounted, by the muster-rolls, to
fifteen thousand men with helmets, seventeen
thousand cross-bows and archers, very heavy
taxes were levied throughout the realm, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
particularly on the city of Paris. It will be
impossible to relate one half of the mischiefs
the armies of both parties committed: suffice
it to say, that churches, churchmen, and the
poor people were very great sufferers.</p>

<p>The Orleans-party, shortly after this,
marched from Chartres to Montlehery, seven
leagues from Paris, and there, and in the
neighbouring villages, quartered their army,
ruining the whole country on their line of
march. The lords and adherents of this
faction, as well clergy as seculars, wore, as
their badge, a narrow band of white linen on
their shoulders, hanging over their left arm,
like to a deacon when celebrating divine
service.</p>

<p>When the king of France and his council
learnt that they had approached so near the
capital, they hastily dispatched to the leaders
the count de la Marche, the archbishop of
Rheims, the bishop of Beauvais, and the grand
master of Rhodes, with some others, to persuade
them to disband their army, and come before
him at Paris, in consequence of his former
orders, without arms, in the manner in which
vassals should wait on their lords, and that
he would do them justice in regard to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
demands; but that, should they refuse, he would
instantly march his forces against them.&mdash;The
princes made answer, that they would not act
otherwise than they had said in their letter to
the king; and the ambassadors, seeing they
could not gain any thing, returned to Paris.</p>

<p>In like manner, the university sent to
them an embassy of learned men, headed by
Noe&eacute;tz, abbot of Povegny and doctor in
divinity, who harangued them very ably and
gravely. They were very handsomely received
by the princes, especially by the duke of Berry,
who, among other grievances, complained
much that his nephew, the king, should be
counselled by such fellows as the provost of
Paris, and others of the same sort, who now
ruled the realm, which was most miserably
governed, as he was ready to explain, article
by article, when they should be admitted to an
audience.</p>

<p>They could obtain no other reply than that,
with God’s pleasure, they would accomplish, to
the utmost of their power, the matters contained
in their circular letters to the university and
principal towns.</p>

<p>On this repeated ill success, the king, by
the advice of his council, sent another embassy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
composed of the queen, the cardinal de Bar,
the count de St Pol, and others. The count
de St Pol had lately accepted, with the king’s
approbation, the office of grand butler of
France, which the provost of Paris had held,
through the interest of the count de Tancarville,
by a gift from the king.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the queen and her
companions were received with every honour,
she did not remain with their army, but went
to the castle of Marcoussi, which is not far
distant from Montlehery, with her attendants,
and remained there some time negotiating with
them, and some of the princes daily visited her.
Although she acted with much perseverance,
she failed in her object,&mdash;for the princes were
firm in their resolution of marching with their
army to the king, and requiring that he would
execute justice and attend to the affairs of
government, and choose another set of ministers
than those now in power.</p>

<p>Finding she was labouring in vain, she
returned with her companions to Paris, and
related to the king all that had passed. He
was very indignant, and much troubled thereat;
and on the morrow, the 23d September, he
ordered all the men at arms that were come to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
serve him to be drawn out, and the baggage
and artillery waggons to be made ready instantly
to march against the Orleans-party, to give
them battle.</p>

<p>When all were ready, and as he was going
to attend mass and afterward to mount his
horse, he was met by the rector of the university,
magnificently accompanied by all the members
and supporters of it, who remonstrated with
him, that his daughter, the university of Paris,
was preparing to leave that city, from the great
want of provisions, which the men at arms of
the two parties prevented coming to Paris,&mdash;for
no one could venture on the high roads
without being robbed and insulted; and,
likewise, that all the low countries round
Paris were despoiled by these men at arms.
They most humbly requested, that he would
provide a remedy, and give them such answer
as might seem to him good. The chancellor,
namely, master Arnauld de Corbie, instantly
replied, ‘The king will assemble his council
after dinner, and you shall have an answer.’
The king of Navarre, being present, entreated
the king that he would fix an hour for
hearing them again after dinner; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
king, complying with his request, appointed an
hour for the rector to return.</p>

<p>When the king had dined, he entered
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chambre verde</i>, attended by the following
princes: the dukes of Acquitaine, Burgundy
and Brabant, the marquis du Pont, the duke
of Lorraine, the counts de Mortain, de Nevers
and de Vaudemont, with many other great
lords, as well ecclesiastical as secular. The
king of Navarre made four requests to the
king: first, that all the princes of the blood,
as well on the one side as on the other, should
retire to their principalities, and never more
interfere in the king’s government, and likewise
that henceforth they should not receive any
profits or pensions, as well from the subsidies
arising from their lands as from other exactions,
but live on their own proper revenues until the
public treasury should be in a better state than
it was at that moment: however, should the
king be inclined to make them presents of any
thing, or call them near his person, they should
be alway ready to obey him.</p>

<p>His second request was, that some
diminution should take place in those taxes
that most aggrieved the people.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>The third, that as some of the citizens of
Paris had lent different sums of money to the
king, of which repayment had been promised,
but not made, sufficient assignments on the
treasury should be given to them.</p>

<p>The fourth, that the affairs of the king
and realm should be governed by prudent men,
taken from the three estates of the kingdom.
When the king of Navarre had ended, the king
himself replied, and said he would take advice
on what he had proposed, and then give him
such answers as ought to satisfy him and every
one else.</p>

<p>When this was over, the king showed the
same determination as before to march, on the
morrow morning, against the rebellious lords;
but he was overruled, and the queen, with the
former ambassadors, were again sent to negotiate
a peace. On their arrival at the army of the
princes, she exerted herself, as it was said very
much and loyally; for it was commonly reported
that she was in her heart inclined to the Orleans
faction.</p>

<p>During the time of this embassy, the count
Am&eacute; de Savoye, who had been sent for by the
king, arrived at Paris with five hundred men
at arms. His brothers-in-law the dukes of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Burgundy and Brabant, and the count de
Nevers, attended by many other lords, went
out to meet him beyond the gate of St Anthony,
and thence conducted him to the palace to the
king, who very kindly received him.</p>

<p>Some days after, the queen, not having
more success than before, returned to the king,
and told him that she could not any way bring
them to terms, for they were obstinate in their
original intentions. She then hastened to the
castle of Vincennes as speedily as she could.</p>

<p>On the ensuing morning, the aforesaid
lords quitted Montlehery; and the duke of
Berry came to his h&ocirc;tel of Vinchestre<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>, which
he had rebuilt, and was there lodged. The
duke of Orleans fixed his quarters at Gentilly,
in the palace of the bishop, and the count
d’Armagnac at Vitry; the rest as near to each
other as they could; and at vespers, they had
advanced as far as the suburbs of St Marcel
and the gate de Bordelles.</p>

<p>The king, the duke of Burgundy, and
the other princes, were greatly surprised at this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
boldness; and the Parisians, at their own
expense, collected a body of a thousand men
armed with helmets to serve as a guard during
the night, and they also made great fires in very
many of the streets. To prevent them from
crossing the Seine at Charenton, they sent two
hundred men at arms to defend that pass.</p>

<p>The third day, Arthur count de Richemont,
brother to the duke of Brittany, joined the dukes
of Berry and Orleans, with six thousand breton
horse, to the great displeasure of the king, and
especially of the duke of Burgundy; for the
duke of Brittany had lately been summoned by
the king to attend him with his Bretons, and
had, for this purpose, received a very large sum
of money. The duke, in consequence, having
other business in hand, sent his brother to serve
the king in his room.</p>

<p>It was also said, that the lord d’Albreth,
constable of France, had disposed of the
money sent him in the same manner, and had
employed it in the service of the duke of Berry.
The army of the princes marched to Saint
Cloud, and to the adjoining towns, which they
plundered, taking by force whatever they were
in need of. Some of the worst of them ravished
and robbed many women, who fled to Paris,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
and made clamorous outcries against their
ravishers, requiring vengeance from the king,
and restitution, were it possible, of what they
had been plundered of.</p>

<p>The king, moved with pity, and by the
importunity of his ministers, ordered a decree
to be drawn out, which condemned the whole
of the Orleans-party to death and confiscation
of goods. While this was doing, the duke
of Berry, uncle to the king, hastily sent
ambassadors to Paris to prevent it from taking
effect, and in the name of their lord requested
that the decree might be a little delayed, when
other means of accommodation, through God’s
grace, would be found.</p>

<p>This request was granted, and the
proclamation of the decree put off: a
negotiation was entered into warmly by both
parties, although the king was very much
displeased that the princes of his blood were
thus quarrelling with each other, so that he
should be forced to proceed with rigour
against them. To prevent the effusion of
blood, the king desired his chancellor and
others of his privy council to exert themselves
diligently that peace might be established; and
he likewise spoke to the same purpose to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
duke of Burgundy, the count de St Pol, and
other princes, who promised faithfully that an
accommodation should take place.</p>

<p>While these matters were going on, the
lord de Dampierre, the bishop of Noyon, the
lord de Tignonville, master Gautier de Col,
and others, ambassadors from the king of
France, were sent from Paris to Boulogne, to
meet an embassy from the king of England,
consisting of the lord Beaumont, the bishop of
St David’s, and others, who had arrived at
Calais to treat of a truce. It was prolonged
from All-saints-day, when the former one
expired, to the feast of Easter ensuing.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XXII">CHAP. XXII.</h2>


<p class="hang">IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS
BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES OF BURGUNDY
AND OF ORLEANS, PEACE IS MADE BETWEEN
THEM, AND CALLED ‘THE PEACE OF
WINCHESTER,’ WHICH WAS THE SECOND
PEACE.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">After</span> the ambassadors from both parties,
namely those of the king and duke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
Burgundy on the one hand, and those of the
dukes of Berry, of Orleans, and of Bourbon,
on the other, had held several conferences, the
following treaty was at length concluded, on
the 2d of November.</p>

<p>The princes of the blood on each side,
with the exception of the count de Mortain,
were to retire to their principalities, and lead
back their forces, committing as little damage
as possible to the countries they should pass
through, without fraud or deception. The
duke of Berry had liberty, if he pleased, to
reside at Giens-sur-Loire, and the count
d’Armagnac might stay there with him for
fifteen days. The king of Navarre was to
depart for his duchy of Nemours. The duke
of Brabant might, if he so pleased, visit his sister,
the duchess of Burgundy, in that country.</p>

<p>The aforesaid princes were to conduct
their men at arms so that all trespassing might
be mutually avoided on each other’s lands,&mdash;nor
should they suffer any of their adherents
to commit waste or damage, so that all
inconvenience or source of quarrel might be
avoided.</p>

<p>Item, in whatever garrisons there shall
be more men than are usually kept, the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
shall be reduced to the accustomed number of
men retained therein for its defence, without
any fraud or deception. And that these terms
may be faithfully observed, the aforesaid lords
shall promise, on their oaths, made before such
princes as the king may nominate, that they will
punctually and loyally keep every article.</p>

<p>Item, the captains of their troops shall
make oath also to the due observance of this
treaty; and if it be the good pleasure of the
king he may appoint some of his knights
as conductors to the men at arms, and
superintendents on their leaders, to prevent
them and their men from delaying their
march, and also from committing waste in
the countries through which they shall pass.</p>

<p>Item, the aforesaid lords will not return
near the person of the king, unless they be sent
for by him, by letters patent under the great
seal, confirmed by his council, or on urgent
business,&mdash;nor shall any of the aforesaid lords
intrigue to obtain orders for their return; and
this they shall especially swear to before
commissioners nominated for the purpose.
The king shall make the terms of this treaty
public, and all the articles they shall swear to
observe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p>Should the king think it necessary to send
for the duke of Berry, he shall, at the same
time, summon the duke of Burgundy, and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vice versa</i>; and this he will observe, in order
that they may both meet at the same time on
the appointed day, which will hold good until
the ensuing Easter in the year 1411; and from
that day until the following Easter in 1412,
no one of the aforesaid shall proceed against
another by acts of violence or by words.&mdash;Every
article of this treaty to be properly
drawn out and signed by the king and his
council, with certain penalties to be incurred
on the infringement of any of them.</p>

<p>Item, the king shall select certain able and
discreet persons, of unblemished characters, and
no way pensioners, but such as have solely given
their oaths of allegiance to the king, to form
the royal council; and when such persons have
been chosen, a list of their names shall be shown
to the princes on each side.</p>

<p>Item, the dukes of Berry and Burgundy,
having the wardship of the duke of Acquitaine,
shall agree together as to the person who shall be
their substitute in that office during their absence;
and powers for so doing shall be sent to the duke
of Berry, as he is at present without them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>Item, the provost of Paris shall be
dismissed from all offices which he holds
under the king, and another shall be appointed
according to the king’s pleasure, and as he
may judge expedient.</p>

<p>Item, it was ordained, that no knight, or
his heirs, should in future suffer any molestation
because he had not obeyed the summons sent
him by either of the parties; and should they
be any way molested, the king would punish
the offender by confiscation of his property.
Letters, confirming this last article, shall be
given by the king and the aforesaid lords to
whoever may require them.</p>

<p>This treaty was concluded on All-saints
day, and on the ensuing Monday confirmed;
and four days after, the greater part of the
articles were fulfilled. Sir John de Neele,
chancellor to the duke of Acquitaine, was,
by the king’s command, appointed to receive
the oaths of the lords on each side.</p>

<p>The king dismissed his provost of Paris,
sir Peter des Essars, knight, from all his offices,
and nominated sir Brunelet de Sainct-Cler,
one of his masters of the household, to the
provostship. He also sent letters, sealed with
his great seal, to the duke of Berry, appointing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
him to the guardianship of his son, the duke
of Acquitaine.</p>

<p>In consequence of one of the articles above
recited, twelve knights, four bishops, and four
lords of the parliament, were appointed to
govern the kingdom,&mdash;namely, the archbishop
of Rheims, the bishops of Noyon and Saint
Flour, master John de Torcy, lately one of
the parliament, but now bishop of Tournay,
the grand master of the king’s household sir
Guichart Daulphin, the grand master of
Rhodes, the lords de Montenay, de Toursy,
de Rambures, d’Offemont, de Rouvroy, de
Rumacourt, Saquet de Toursy, le vidame
d’Amiens, sir John de Toursy, knight to the
duke of Berry, and grand master of his
household, and the lord de St George. The
two last were nominated, by the dukes of
Berry and Burgundy, guardians to the duke
of Acquitaine during their absence.</p>

<p>The two parties now left Paris and the
adjoining fortresses and castles; but on the
following Saturday, the king was again
strongly seized with his usual malady, and
confined in his h&ocirc;tel of St Pol. The queen
and her attendants, then at Vincennes, returned
to Paris with her son, the duke of Acquitaine,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
and fixed their residence, with her lord, in the
h&ocirc;tel de St Pol.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy went to Meaux,
where he was met by the king of Navarre;&mdash;and
thence the duke went to Arras and Flanders,
accompanied by sir Peter des Essars, late provost
of Paris, and his most confidential adviser; and
he always gave him the title of provost of Paris,
as though he had still retained the office.</p>

<p>Conformably to the treaty, all the men at
arms on each side returned to the places whence
they had come, but plundering the poor people
on their march. A number of Lombards and
Gascons had formed part of the army of the
duke of Orleans, who were mounted on terrible
horses, that were taught to wheel round when
on full gallop, which seemed very astonishing
to the French, Flemings, Picards, and
Brabanters, who had not been accustomed
to such movements.</p>

<p>Because the count d’Armagnac had joined
the duke of Orleans with a large body, his men
were called <i>Armagnacs</i>; and in consequence, the
whole of that faction were called <i>Armagnacs</i>.
Although there were many princes of much
higher rank in either party than the count
d’Armagnac, they were not pleased if they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
were not called by this name, which lasted
a very considerable time.</p>

<p>As the treaty before mentioned had been
concluded at the h&ocirc;tel de Winchester, where
the dukes of Berry and Orleans, with others
of their party were amusing themselves, it was
called ‘The Peace of Winchester.’</p>

<p>All who had come to these meetings at
Paris now departed, and those to whom the
government had been intrusted remained
near the person of the king and the duke
of Acquitaine. The people expected, that by
this means they should enjoy more peaceable
times; but it happened just the contrary, as
you shall shortly hear.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAP_XXIII">CHAP. XXIII.</h2>


<p class="hang">A MEETING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND CLERGY
IS HELD ON THE XXIII. OF NOVEMBER, IN
THE CHURCH OF ST BERNARD AT PARIS, ON
THE STATE OF THE CHURCH.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> peace had been established, a large
congregation was held, by order of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
university, on the 23d of November, in the
church of the Bernardins in Paris,&mdash;to which
were called, the bishop of Puy in Auvergne,
many other prelates, and in general all
bachelors and licentiates in canon and civil
law, although in former times doctors only
had been summoned.</p>

<p>This assembly was holden at the request
of the archbishop of Pisa, and other legates
from the pope, on the subject of tythes, the
vacant benefices, and the effects of the dead.
But it was opened by the adoption of a solemn
ordinance, which had been ordained during
the papacy of Pietro della Luna, respecting
the liberties of the french church, in the year
1406, and since confirmed by the king, his
great council, and the parliament, namely,
that the said church shall be maintained in all
its ancient privileges. It was thus freed from
all tythes, procurations, and subsidies, or taxes
whatever. And as the object of these legates
was to establish the above impositions, it was
resolved that the aforesaid ordinance should be
strictly conformed to; and the more effectually
to have it observed, they sent deputations to the
king, to his council, and to the parliament, to
whom the guard of this ordinance belonged,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
to obviate the inconveniences that might follow
should any article of it be infringed.</p>

<p>It was also concluded, that should the
legates attempt, by menaces of ecclesiastical
censures or otherwise, to compel payment of
any tribute, an appeal should be made from
them to a general council of the church.</p>

<p>Item, should any collectors or sub-collectors
exact subsidies to the church, they shall be
arrested, and punished by confiscation of
property, and, when they have no property,
by imprisonment.</p>

<p>It was also concluded, that to settle this
matter, the king’s attorney, and other lords,
should be requested to join the university.
But it was at last resolved, that should the
pope plead an evident want of means to
support the church, a council should be
called, and a charitable subsidy granted, the
which should be collected by certain discreet
persons selected by the council, and the
amount distributed according to the directions
of the said council.</p>

<p>On the ensuing Monday was held a royal
sessions, at which the duke of Acquitaine, the
archbishop of Pisa, and the other legates from
the pope, the rector and the members of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
university were present. In this meeting, the
archbishop declared, that what he demanded
was due to the apostolic chamber, by every
right, divine, canon, civil and natural, and that
it was sacred and simple justice,&mdash;adding, that
whoever should deny this right was scarcely a
Christian.</p>

<p>The university was greatly displeased, and
said, that such expressions were derogatory to
the king’s honour, to that of the university,
and consequently of the whole kingdom.
From what had passed, another general
assembly was holden on Sunday the 30th of
November, in the place where it had been
held the preceding Sunday; and it was then
determined that the university should send a
deputation to the king, to lay before him the
words uttered by the legates, and to demand
that they should be publicly recanted by them.
It was proposed, that in case they should
refuse so to do, the faculty of theologians
should bring accusations against them, on the
articles of faith, and they should be punished
according to the exigence of the case. It was
also resolved, that the university of Paris should
write letters to all the other universities in the
realm, and to the prelates and clergy, to invite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
them to unite in their opposition to such
tenets.</p>

<p>Many other things were agitated in this
meeting, which I pass over for the sake of
brevity. It was, however, finally concluded to
send an answer to the pope, that he could not
have any subsidy granted him in the way which
had been proposed. The meeting came to the
resolution, that the university of Paris should
require from the archbishop of Rheims, and
those of the members of the king’s government
who, as members, had given their oaths to the
university, to join in the measures they had
adopted, otherwise they should be expelled the
university.</p>

<p>It should be known, that while these
things were passing, the legates, fearful of the
consequences, hastily left Paris, without taking
leave, as is usually done. The holy father,
however, sent ambassadors to the king, to
demand payment of the tenth imposed on the
french church. When they declared the object
of their mission to the council of state, and in
the presence of the duke of Acquitaine, they
said, that not only was the french church
bound to pay this subsidy to the pope, but all
other churches which were under his obedience,&mdash;first,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
from the divine law in Leviticus, which
declares that all deacons shall pay to the high
priest a tenth of their possessions,&mdash;and, 2dly,
by natural and positive law.</p>

<p>Whilst these things were passing, the
university came to the council, and on the
morrow a congregation was held in the
monastery of the Bernardins. It was then
resolved that the manner of demanding this
subsidy should be reprobated, for that it was
iniquitous, and contrary to the decree of the
king and his council in the year 1406, for the
preservation of the franchises of the french
church. The university insisted on this decree
being preserved inviolate, and declared, that if
the pope or his legates attempted to constrain
any person to pay this subsidy by censures of
the church, it would appeal to a general
council on this subject. Should any of the
new ministers attempt any thing against this
decree, the university would appeal to the king
and the whole council of state; and should any
members of the university urge the payment of
this tenth, they should be expelled; and if any
persons, guilty of the above offence, should
have any property of their own, the university
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
would require that the said property should be
confiscated to the king’s use, otherwise they
should be imprisoned.</p>

<p>Should the holy father adopt the manner
of raising this subsidy by way of charity, it
would be agreeable to the university that the
king should call together the prelates of his
realm,&mdash;first, to consider what subjects should
be discussed in the general council of the church
to be holden on this occasion; secondly, to
deliberate on the demands made by the
ambassadors respecting the tenth. Should it
be determined for the pope to receive this
subsidy, the university expressed its wish that
some sufficient person should be deputed from
this kingdom to receive the amount of the
same, for the peace and union of the greek
and latin churches, and from England for aid
of the holy land, and the preaching the gospel
to all the world; for such were the purposes
for which the legates declared the holy father
raised this subsidy. The university solicited
the members of the parliament to unite
themselves with them, for it was in support
of their decree made on the demand of the
king’s attorney-general.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>Juvenal des Ursins<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> was deputed by
the university to reply to what the pope’s
ambassadors had advanced before the council;
but at length the archbishop of Pisa, perceiving
he could not otherwise gain his object, humbled
himself much before the university, and spoke
privately to some of the principal members to
prevail on them to assist him. However, on
the 28th day of January, it was declared, that
no subsidy whatever should be granted to the
pope without the previous consent of the french
church; and the deliberation on this matter
was deferred to the 10th of February, when
many prelates were summoned to give their
opinions thereon. Through the active diligence
of the university, the legates could not obtain
consent that a subsidy in any shape should be
granted to the pope, although the greater part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
of the lords, and in particular the princes, were
very agreeable to it.</p>

<p>While these matters were transacting at
Paris, the holy father sent letters to the king of
France and to the university, to say that the
Florentines refused any longer to obey him,
from fear of king Ladislaus; that this king
Ladislaus was assembling an immense army,
as the pope wrote word, to conquer Rome and
the adjacent country, that he might place in
the chair of St Peter a pope according to his
pleasure. Should this happen, a more ruinous
schism might befal the church than the former
one,&mdash;to obviate which, he requested from the
king, the princes, and university, aid and
support. This was, through the intercession
of the archbishop of Pisa, complied with, and
in the manner that shall be hereafter related.

<h2 id="CHAP_XXIV">CHAP. XXIV.</h2>


<p class="hang">THE LORD DE CROY IS MADE PRISONER WHEN
GOING ON AN EMBASSY FROM THE DUKE OF
BURGUNDY TO THE DUKE OF BERRY, TO THE
GREAT DISPLEASURE OF THE LATTER.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke of Burgundy, shortly after he had
left Paris, sent three of his counsellors, namely,
the lords de Croy and de Dours, knights, and
master Raoul, head canon of Tournay and
of Amiens, licentiate of law, as ambassadors
to the king at Paris, and to his uncle and
godfather, the duke of Berry, at Bourges. But
when they were travelling between Orleans
and Bourges, the lord de Croy was arrested by
the officers of the duke of Orleans on the last
day but one of January, without any molestation
being given to the other two ambassadors or
their attendants.</p>

<p>He was carried to a castle within three
leagues of Blois, and, on the morrow, strictly
interrogated respecting the murder of the late
duke of Orleans, and put to the torture to
confess if he had been any way consenting to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
it, or an accomplice in it; but they could not
discover any thing to his prejudice. On the
following Sunday, he was carried to Blois, and
confined in the dungeons of a prison.</p>

<p>The other ambassadors continued their
route to Bourges, where, having explained to
the duke of Berry the object of their mission,
they humbly entreated that he would exert
himself with the duke of Orleans that the
lord de Croy might obtain his liberty. When
they related to him the manner of the lord de
Croy being arrested, the duke was filled with
indignation, and instantly sent letters signed
with his hand to the duke of Orleans, to say
that he must immediately give up his prisoner,
whom he had illegally arrested when coming
to him; and that if he did not do it, he would
have him for his enemy.</p>

<p>The duke of Orleans, on the receipt of
this letter, considered it well, and replied at
length most courteously to the duke of Berry,
excusing himself for what he had done, but
putting off the setting the lord de Croy at
liberty. The king and the duke of Acquitaine
were soon made acquainted with this arrest,&mdash;and
they sent letters to the duke of Orleans,
commanding him instantly to deliver the lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
de Croy from his imprisonment, on pain of
incurring their indignation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these letters, the duke
of Orleans would not give him his liberty, but
kept him in close confinement, where he was
very often most rigorously treated, and at times
examined and put to the torture.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the other ambassadors
sent messengers to the duke of Burgundy, to
notify to him this conduct and the means they
had taken in vain for the deliverance of the
lord de Croy.</p>

<p>The duke was much surprised and vexed
at this news, for he greatly loved the lord de
Croy. Having considered this insult, and
others that had been offered to his friends, he
thought it time to take effectual measures for
his security, and in consequence amassed as
large a sum as he could: to this end, he sold
his right to all confiscations within the town
of Ghent to the townsmen, and yielded for
money several other privileges to the Flemings.
He likewise carried his son, the count de
Charolois, to show him to many of the
principal towns as their future lord, who, on
this occasion, made him considerable presents.
He afterward held a grand council on his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
affairs, in the town of Tournay, which was
attended by his brothers-in-law duke William
and the bishop of Liege. The count de
Namur was also present, and several great
lords from the borders of the empire. The
duke of Burgundy solicited their aid against
his enemies, should need be, and in particular
against the duke of Orleans, his brothers and
allies. This service they offered him liberally,
to the utmost of their power. Having obtained
their promises, he went to Lille, whither the
marshal Boucicaut, late governor of Genoa,
came to meet him. He received him very
kindly, and carried him with him to his town
of Arras, whither he had convoked all the
lords and nobles of the county of Artois and
its dependancies.</p>

<p>When they were assembled in the great
hall of his residence, he addressed them himself,
and caused them to be harangued by master
William Bouvier, knight, licentiate of law, to
explain how his enemies were plotting daily to
arrest and imprison his friends, and had actually
arrested and imprisoned the lord de Croy; for
which cause he had now assembled them, to
request that they would remain loyal, and that,
should there be a necessity, they would enter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
into his pay and serve him,&mdash;for they might be
assured it would be solely in his own defence,
and for that of the king and the duke of
Acquitaine, that he would ever take up arms.
He declared, that it was merely for the
preservation of the crown to his present
majesty, and to his heirs, that he had slain
the duke of Orleans, father to the present
duke. This death had been lately pardoned,
and peace established by the king in the town
of Chartres, and proclaimed by letters patent.
He added, that should any of the conditions
of that treaty of Chartres be unaccomplished
by him, he was ready to fulfil them, and
willing to do any thing else that would afford
satisfaction.</p>

<p>When he had concluded his speech, the
nobles and knights present unanimously replied,
that they would serve him to the utmost of their
power. The meeting then broke up, and each
man returned to his own country and home.</p>

<p>The marshal Boucicaut went to Paris,
and in full council, presided by the duke of
Acquitaine in the place of his father, he
accused the Genoese of various crimes, and
exculpated himself for having lost that town;
and ended by entreating, that he might be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
sufficiently supplied with men and money to
offer them battle and regain it.</p>

<p>The council deferred giving an answer at
the moment, but appointed a day for him to
receive it. In the mean time, Boucicaut waited
on all the principal lords, to interest them in
his cause, and to beg that they would press the
king and council to hasten a compliance with
his request. It was ordered by the council,
conjunctively with the three estates, that the
Genoese should be summoned to appear before
them at Paris, at the feast of Easter, when
many of the nobles would be there assembled
on other weighty affairs, particularly to have
their consent that the duke of Acquitaine
should be appointed regent of the kingdom,
for the Parisians were extremely pressing that
this should be done.</p>

<p>The duke of Berry, however, was much
displeased when he heard of it, and, to prevent
it, wrote urgent letters to the duke of Acquitaine,
to the queen, and to the great council, giving
substantial reasons why this could not and
ought not to be done, considering how very
young the duke of Acquitaine was,&mdash;adding,
that he and his brother Philip duke of
Burgundy, of good memory, had sworn on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
the holy sacrament that they would support
and defend, to their last drop of blood, their
nephew, the king now on the throne, against
all who should attempt any thing to his
dishonour or disadvantage.</p>

<p>While these things were in agitation, the
king recovered his health,&mdash;and of course, the
duke of Acquitaine was not regent, to the great
satisfaction of the duke of Berry, who was much
rejoiced thereat.</p>

<p>In consequence of the quarrel that had
now again broken out between the dukes of
Orleans and Burgundy, the king issued a
proclamation to all the bailiwicks, provostships,
seneschalships and governments in his realm, to
forbid all nobles, of whatever rank they might
be, and every other person, to obey the summons
or join in arms either of the above dukes, under
pain of their property being confiscated.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday of the holy week, the
duke of Bourbon and the count de Vertus,
brother to the duke of Orleans, marched five
hundred men at arms to Clermont in Beauvoisis,
and thence invaded Normandy. The count de
Vertus did not remain long there, but, taking
a part of the men at arms, left the duke of
Bourbon, and hastened to the countries of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
the Soissonnois and Valois, to the territory of
Coucy, which belonged to his brother, and
there placed a good garrison.</p>

<p>True it is, that when the duke of
Burgundy heard this, he was much troubled,
and, as speedily as he could, ordered his men
at arms to meet him at Ch&acirc;teau-Cambresis the
last day but one of April. But when these
transactions came to the knowledge of the
king and council, he sent able ambassadors to
each of these dukes, to forbid them, under pain
of having all their lands confiscated, and being
declared enemies to their king and country, to
attempt any expeditions against each other,
and commanded them instantly to disband
their forces. For this time they very humbly
obeyed his orders, and deferred proceeding
further for a considerable space.

CHAP. XXV.</h2>


<p class="hang">THE DUKE OF ORLEANS SENDS AMBASSADORS
TO THE KING OF FRANCE, WITH LETTERS
OF ACCUSATION AGAINST THE DUKE OF
BURGUNDY AND THOSE OF HIS PARTY.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">At</span> the commencement of this year, the duke
of Orleans was displeased that those ministers
who had been nominated by the duke of
Burgundy had greater influence than any of
the others, and that they daily deprived such
as had been attached to the late duke of
Orleans, and were now his friends, of their
offices. In consequence, he sent ambassadors
to the king to complain of this conduct, and
to require that the murderers of his father
should be punished conformably to the articles
of the treaty, but who were now residents
within the kingdom. To these ambassadors
promises were made, on the part of the king,
that proper remedies should be applied to give
them satisfaction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>On their departure, the king sent to his
uncle, the duke of Berry, at Bourges, to
require that he would interfere between his
two nephews of Orleans and Burgundy, and
make peace between them, which he engaged
to do; and in consequence, he sent his
chancellor, the archbishop of Bourges, to
Paris, well instructed by the duke how he
was to act.</p>

<p>Shortly after, this chancellor, the marshal
Boucicaut, with others, were dispatched to the
duke of Burgundy, then at St Omer, who,
having heard all they had to say, replied, that
it was no fault of his, nor should it ever be
so, that any articles of the late treaties were
infringed; for that in this, and in every thing
else, he was very desirous of obeying the king.
And this his answer they laid before the king
and council.</p>

<p>But as the proceedings against the
murderers of the late duke of Orleans did not
seem to his son, and his advisers, to be carried
on with sufficient vigour, he wrote letters,
signed with his own hand, to complain of this
and other matters to the king, the contents of
which were as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>‘Most redoubted lord, after offering
my humble recommendation,&mdash;lately, very
redoubted lord, two of your counsellors came
to me, namely, sir Collart de Charleville, knight,
and sir Simon de Nanterre, president of your
parliament, whom you had been pleased to
send me to signify and explain your good will
and pleasure touching certain points, which
they have clearly and distinctly declared,
according to the terms of their commission.</p>

<p>‘First, they require and entreat of me, in
your name, who may command me as your
loyal subject and humble servant, that I should
submit the quarrel that subsists between me and
the duke of Burgundy, for the inhuman and
cruel murder of my very redoubted lord and
father, and your own brother, on whose soul
may God have mercy! to my lady the queen,
and to my lord and uncle the duke of Berry,
who has been in like manner solicited by your
ambassadors to labour diligently to establish
a firm peace, for the general good of the
kingdom.</p>

<p>‘They have informed me, that you have
also made a similar proposal to the duke of
Burgundy,&mdash;and that, to effectuate so desirable
an object as peace, I should send four of my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
friends to my said uncle of Berry, who will
there meet the same number from the duke of
Burgundy.</p>

<p>‘The second point mentioned by them is,
that you entreat I would desist from assembling
men at arms.</p>

<p>‘Thirdly, that I would accept of letters
from you similar to those which had been
formerly sent me at my request, respecting the
murderers, and their accomplices, of my late
father and your brother.</p>

<p>‘Having very maturely weighed and
considered the above points, I reply, that
I most humbly thank you, very redoubted
lord, for your grace and kindness in thus
sending to me; and I can assure you, that I
have no greater pleasure than in hearing often
from you, and of your noble state; that I was,
and am always ready to serve and obey you in
body and fortune, to the utmost extent of my
own and my subjects’ abilities.</p>

<p>‘But as the matters which they have
mentioned to me in your name are of very
high consideration and importance, concerning
yourself and your noble state, and as I shall
ever be most anxious to show my ready
obedience to your will, I was unable at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
moment to make them any reply, excepting
that I would send you an answer as speedily
as I could. This I have hitherto deferred, for
I know you have near your person, and in your
council, several of my bitter enemies, whom
you ought to regard as yours also, and to whom
I am unwilling that my answer, or my future
intentions, should be made known: neither is
it right they should be made acquainted with
what concerns me, or have the opportunity of
giving their opinions in council, or elsewhere,
relative thereto.</p>

<p>‘I therefore assure you, most redoubted
lord, in the fullest manner, that I am your
humble son and nephew, ready at all times
to obey you as my sovereign lord, and most
heartily anxious to honour and exalt to the
utmost of my power your crown and dignity,
as well as that of the queen, the duke of
Acquitaine, and all your other children and
kingdom, and to advise you most loyally and
faithfully, without ever concealing any thing
from you that may tend to the glory of your
crown, or to the welfare of your realm.</p>

<p>‘I have some time hesitated to denounce
to you such of my enemies, and yours also, as
are in your council and service, namely, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
bishop of Tournay, the vidame d’Amiens,
John de Neelles<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>, the lord de Heilly, Charles
de Savoisy, Anthony des Essars, John de
Courcelles, Peter de Fontenay and Maurice
de Railly, who, by force or underhand means,
are capable of doing me great mischief,
insomuch that they have dismissed certain very
able men from their offices, who were your
trusty servants, and have done them very great
and irreparable damages: they are guilty also
of insinuating very many falsehoods, to keep
myself and others, your relations and faithful
servants, at a distance from you, by which,
and other means equally dishonourable and
iniquitous, long followed by them and their
adherents, have they troubled the peace of the
kingdom: nor is it very probable that so long
as such persons shall remain in power, and in
your service, any firm or lasting peace can be
established; for they will always prevent you
from doing justice to myself or to others,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
which ought indifferently to be done to all,&mdash;to
the poor as well as to the rich.</p>

<p>‘This conduct they pursue, because they
know themselves guilty of many crimes, and
especially John de Neelles and the lord de
Heilly, who were accomplices in the murder
of my late honoured father, and your only
brother, under the protection of the duke of
Burgundy, the principal in this crime. They
are his sworn servants and pensioners, or allies
to the said duke, whence they may be reputed
actors and accomplices in this base and
cowardly assassination. These accomplices,
most redoubted lord, appear daily in your
presence, and you ought to consider their
crimes in the same light as if done personally
against you, for indeed your authority was set
at nought.</p>

<p>‘That I may now say all that I know, I
am satisfied, that had not the course of your
justice been checked by the aforesaid persons
and their accomplices, ample justice would
have been done for the death of my lord and
father, and your brother, with the aid of your
officers and loyal subjects, as I know for certain
that they were well inclined to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>‘For this I am very thankful; and I
most earnestly pray you, for your own honour,
for that of the queen and of the duke of
Acquitaine, as well as for the honour of your
kingdom, that you would do good and fair
justice, by causing these guilty persons to be
arrested and punished, since they are equally
your enemies as mine,&mdash;and that you would
not longer admit to your presence and councils
the partisans of the duke of Burgundy, but
select in their places good, loyal, and able
men, such as may be found in abundance in
your kingdom.</p>

<p>‘When these things shall be done, I will
then, under God’s pleasure, send you such
answer, that you may clearly know my inmost
thoughts, and which shall prove satisfactory to
God, to yourself, and to the world. For the
love of God, I pray you, my most redoubted
lord, do not neglect doing this; otherwise I
see plainly, that whatever supplications or
requests I make to you will never be attended
to, although they be conformable to reason
and justice, and that you will be prevented
from acting in the manner you have proposed,
through your ambassadors to me, nor shall I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
be able to do what they have required from
me on your part.</p>

<p>‘Therefore, my most redoubted lord, I
beg you will not disappoint me; for what I
have required is but just and reasonable, as will
be apparent to any one. My very dear lord,
may it please you to order me according to
your good pleasure, and, with the will of God,
I will obey you faithfully in all things.’</p>

<p>When the duke of Orleans had sent this
letter to the king, he wrote others of the like
tenour to the chancellor of France, and to such
of the ministers as he knew were favourable to
him, to entreat that they would earnestly exert
themselves in pressing the king, queen, and
duke of Acquitaine, to dismiss those of the
council who governed under the name of the
duke of Burgundy, and whose names have been
already noticed,&mdash;and that he might obtain
justice on the murderers of his late father.
Notwithstanding the many attempts he made
by repeated letters to the king and to others,
he could not at that time, through the
interposition before mentioned, obtain any
answer which was satisfactory.

<p class="hang">THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF BAR.&mdash;THE KING
OF FRANCE SENDS AN EMBASSY TO THE DUKE
OF BURGUNDY,&mdash;AND OTHER MATTERS.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> this year died that valiant and wise man
Henry duke of Bar, and was succeeded by his
eldest son Edward, marquis du Pont, in the
duchy of Bar and castlewick of Cassel,
excepting a part which he had bequeathed
as an inheritance, after his decease, to Robert
de Bar, son to the deceased Henry de Bar, his
eldest son, and to the lady de Coucy, namely,
Varneston, Bourbourg, Dunkirk and Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
In consequence of his death, Edward was
styled Duke of Bar, and began his reign
prosperously.</p>

<p>At this period, the king of France sent
ambassadors to the duke of Burgundy, who,
beside what they delivered to him in speech,
gave him the letters which the duke of Orleans
had written to the king, containing his charges
against him and his accomplices. He was
much displeased at this conduct, and made
reply by these ambassadors, that the charges
brought against him by the duke of Orleans
were untrue. When he had received the
ambassadors with every honour, he took leave
of them, and went to his county of Flanders:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
and they returned to Paris without any
satisfactory answer to the matters concerning
which they had been sent.</p>

<p>It was not long before the duke of
Burgundy raised a large body of men at arms,
whom he sent into the Cambresis, and toward
St Quentin; but immediately after, by orders
from the king and council, he dismissed them
to the places whence they had come.</p>

<p>On the 15th day of July, master John
Petit, doctor of divinity, whom the duke of
Orleans had intended to prosecute, before the
university of Paris, for heresy, died in the
town of Hesdin, in the h&ocirc;tel of the hospital
which the duke of Burgundy had given him,
beside large pensions, and was buried in the
church of the Friars Minors in the town of
Hesdin.</p>

<p>At this time, a tax was laid on the clergy
of France and of Dauphiny, of half a tenth,
by the pope, with the consent of the king, the
princes, and the university of Paris, and the
greater part of the prelates and cities, to be
paid by two instalments; the first on Magdalen
day, and the second at Whitsuntide following.
It was so rigorously collected that the poorer
clergy complained bitterly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p>During this transaction, and while the
duke of Burgundy was resident in his town of
Bruges, on Saturday the 10th of July, sir Am&eacute;
de Sarrebrusse, sir Clugnet de Brabant, and
other captains of the duke of Orleans, came,
with a numerous body of men at arms, before
Coucy, in the Vermandois, and Ham sur
Somme.</p>

<p>News of this was soon carried to the
duke of Burgundy, who, suspecting they
intended to invade and make war on his
territories, gave commissions to several of
his captains, namely, the lord de Heilly,
Enguerrand de Bournouville, the lord de
Ront, and some others, to march a body of
men at arms towards Bapaume and Ham, to
oppose the Armagnacs, should they attempt
to penetrate further into the country.</p>

<p>During this time, the duke of Orleans
and his brothers continued their solicitations
for justice, and again sent letters to the king,
princes, cities, and prelates, to engage them
to unite with them in obtaining the object of
their petitions. The tenour of the letter they
wrote to the king is as follows.

<p  class="hang">THE DUKE OF ORLEANS AND HIS BROTHERS
SEND LETTERS TO THE KING OF FRANCE,
TO OTHER LORDS, AND TO SEVERAL OF
THE PRINCIPAL TOWNS IN FRANCE, TO
COMPLAIN OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">‘Most</span> redoubted and sovereign lord,&mdash;we
Charles duke of Orleans, Philip count de
Vertus, and John count of Angoul&ecirc;me,
brothers, your very humble children and
nephews, have, with all due humiliation and
submission, considered it right to lay before
you, jointly and separately, what follows.</p>

<p>‘Although the barbarous and cruel
murder of our redoubted lord and very dear
father, your brother, must for certain be most
strongly impressed on your royal memory, and
engraven on your heart,&mdash;nevertheless, most
redoubted lord, our grief and the sense of
what is due to us from all laws, human and
divine, force us to renew in your memory
all the minute transactions of that inhuman
event.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>‘It is a fact, most dear lord, that John,
who styles himself duke of Burgundy, through
a hatred he had long nourished in his breast,
and from an insatiate ambition and a desire of
governing your realm, and that he might have
the office of regent, as he has clearly shown
and daily continues to show, did, on the 14th
day of November in the year 1407, most
treacherously murder your brother, our most
renowned lord and father, in the streets of
Paris, and during the night, by causing him
to be waylaid by a set of infamous wretches,
hired for this purpose, without having
previously testified any displeasure towards
him. This is well known to all the world;
for it has been publicly avowed by the traitorous
murderer himself, who is more disloyal, cruel,
and inhuman than you can imagine; and we
do not believe you can find in any writings one
of a more perverse or faithless character.</p>

<p>‘In the first place, they were so nearly
connected by blood, being cousins-german, the
children of two brothers, that it adds to his
crime of murder that of parricide; and the
laws cannot too severely punish so detestable
an action. They were also brothers in arms,
having twice or thrice renewed this confederation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
under their own hands and seals, and solemnly
sworn on the holy sacrament, in the presence
of very many prelates and nobles, that they
would be true and loyal friends,&mdash;that they
would not do any thing to the prejudice of
each other, either openly or secretly, nor suffer
any such like thing to be done by others.</p>

<p>‘They, besides, entered into various
protestations of love and friendship, making
the most solemn promises to continue true
brothers in arms, as is usual in such cases, to
demonstrate that they felt a perfect friendship
for each other; and as a confirmation of their
affection, they mutually wore each other’s
colours and badges.</p>

<p>‘Secondly, he proved the perverseness
of his heart by the manner in which this
murder was committed. Under cover of his
pretended affection for your aforesaid brother,
he conversed frequently with him; and once
when he was ill, a short time before his death,
he visited him at his house of Beaut&eacute; sur Marne,
and in Paris, showing him every sign of love
and friendship that brother, cousin, or friend
could testify,&mdash;when, at the same time, he had
plotted his death, had sent for the murderers
to Paris, and had even hired the house to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
hide them in, which clearly demonstrates the
wickedness and disloyalty of his heart.</p>

<p>‘In addition to what I have just stated,
and the very day before the murder took place,
after the council which you had held at the
h&ocirc;tel de St Pol was broken up, they both, in
your presence and before the other princes of
the blood who were there, drank wine and ate
together; and your brother invited him to dine
with him the Sunday following. The duke of
Burgundy accepted the invitation, although he
knew what a diabolical attempt he harboured
in his heart, and that it would be put into
effect the very first favourable opportunity.
This is an abomination disgraceful even to
relate.</p>

<p>‘On the morrow, therefore, notwithstanding
all his fair promises and oaths, being obstinately
bent upon his wicked purpose, he caused him
to be put to death with more cruelty than ever
man of any rank suffered, by those whom he
had hired to waylay and murder him, and
who had, for a long time, been watching their
opportunity. They first cut off his right hand,
which was found the next day in the dirt: they
then cut his left arm so that it held only by the
skin, and, beside, fractured and laid open his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
skull in several places that his brains were
scattered in the street; and they then dragged
his body through the mud, until it was quite
lifeless.</p>

<p>‘It would be pitiful to hear of such
barbarous conduct towards the meanest subject:
how much the more horror must the recital
cause, when it was practised on the first prince
of the blood of France! Never was any branch
of your noble race so cruelly and infamously
treated,&mdash;and you and all of your blood,
and such of your subjects as wish you well,
ought not to suffer such a lamentable deed
to be perpetrated without any punishment or
reparation whatever, as is the case till this
present time, which is the most shameful
thing that ever happened, or ever could
happen, to so noble a house; and additional
disgrace will fall upon it, if you any longer
delay justice.</p>

<p>‘Thirdly, he shows his perverseness and
obstinacy by false and damnable hypocrisy;
for after the horrid deed had been done, he
came with the other princes dressed in black,
to attend the body, pretending the utmost
grief at the funeral for the loss of his brother
in arms, thinking by this means to cover the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
wickedness of his sin. It would be tiresome
to relate all the damnable and hypocritical
arts he employed to hide the treacherous and
murderous part he had acted, until he perceived
that his crime must be brought to light by the
diligence of your officers of justice.</p>

<p>‘He then, and then only, confessed to
the king of Sicily, and to the duke of Berry,
that he had perpetrated this murder, or at least
had caused it to be committed; and that the
devil had tempted him to do it, for that in
truth he could not assign any other cause for
having so done. But he was not contented
with murdering his body: he wanted again,
so great is his iniquity, to murder his fame
and fair reputation by false and wicked
accusations, when he was no more able to
defend himself against them. The falsehood
of these charges, through the grace of God,
is notorious to you and to the whole world.</p>

<p>‘My late most redoubted lady-mother,
whose soul may God receive! suffered the
utmost tribulation, not only for the death of
her much-beloved lord and husband, but also
for the inhuman and cruel manner of it; and
like one in despair, attended by me, John of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Angoul&ecirc;me, she waited on you, as her king
and sovereign lord, and her sole refuge in this
her distress, and most humbly supplicated that
you would, out of your benign goodness, have
compassion on her and her children, and would
order such prompt and just judgment to be
executed on the perpetrators of this murder as
the blackness of the case required; and as you
are bound in your quality of king to administer
strict justice to all your subjects without delay,
as well to the poor as to the rich, so rather the
more promptly ought you to exercise it in favour
of the poor and deserted than for the rich and
powerful; for this upright administration of
justice is a great virtue, and on this account
were kings chiefly appointed, and power
intrusted to their hands. The case that was
then and is now again brought before you
requires the most speedy justice; for it not
only concerns you as king, but affects you more
sensibly and personally,&mdash;for her husband, our
much regretted lord, who was so treacherously
slain, was your only brother, and, consequently,
strict justice ought to have been granted to her,
and done on the murderers.</p>

<p>‘You did indeed appoint a day for
doing her this justice; on which account, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
constantly employed her agents near your
person, to remind you thereof: she waited
long after the appointed day had elapsed for
the judgment which you had promised her,&mdash;and,
notwithstanding all her diligence and
exertions, she met with nothing but delays,
caused by the means of the aforesaid traitor,
his friends and adherents, as shall be more
fully explained hereafter.</p>

<p>‘However, most redoubted lord, I know
for certain, that your inclinations were very
willing to do us justice, and that they still
remain the same. Our most afflicted mother,
attended by me Charles of Orleans, again
returned; and we renewed our request to have
judgment executed on the assassins of our late
lord and father. We also caused to be most
fully detailed before my lord of Acquitaine,
your eldest son, and by you commissioned as
your lieutenant on this occasion, and before
the queen, every circumstance relative to the
murder, and the infamous charges urged by
way of exculpation by the murderer, and the
causes why he had committed this atrocious
crime. We, at the same time, fully replied to
what had been argued in his defence; and after
this, our lady-mother caused conclusions to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
drawn against the aforesaid traitor, according
to the usual customs of your reign, and required
that your attorney should join with her in the
further prosecution of the criminals, so that
they might be brought to justice.</p>

<p>‘When this was done, our very redoubted
lord the duke of Acquitaine, by the advice of
the princes of your blood and divers others
of your council, then present at the Louvre,
made answer to our lady-mother, that, as your
lieutenant, he and the princes of the blood, and
the members of your council, were satisfied,
and pleased with the justifications offered by
our lady-mother in behalf of your brother, our
much redoubted father, whose soul may God
pardon! and that they considered him as fully
innocent of the charges brought against him,
and added, that substantial justice should be
done to her satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Notwithstanding all these promises,
there was much delay in their execution,
insomuch that she frequently renewed her
solicitations to you, the princes of your blood,
and to your council, and used various other
means to obtain justice, the recital of which
would tire you: nevertheless, she could never
gain the assistance of your attorney-general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
in prosecuting the aforesaid criminals to
judgment, which circumstance is lamentable
to think on.</p>

<p>‘For the aforesaid traitor, well knowing
your inclination to execute justice, knowing
also that his crime could by no means be
justified, in order to prevent matters being
pushed to extremity, (notwithstanding your
positive orders to him, to forbid his appearing
at Paris, with any body of men at arms) came
thither with a powerful force, composed of
foreigners, and several who had been banished
your realm, who did great mischief to the
countries through which they passed, as is
notorious to every one.</p>

<p>‘Your and our lady the queen, with the
duke of Acquitaine, your son and heir, and the
princes of the blood, were forced to quit your
capital before he arrived there. He remained,
therefore, in your town of Paris lord paramount,
and conducted himself in a tyrannical manner,
subversive of your dominion, and contrary to
the interests of the people. To avoid greater
inconveniences and oppressions on your subjects
from him and his men at arms, it was judged
expedient that you, the royal family and council
of state should, according to his good pleasure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
come to Chartres, and there grant him whatever
he should ask. Thus he thought he should be
acquitted of all the traitorous acts and murders
which he had committed, by trampling your
justice under his feet. Consequently he refuses
to suffer any of your officers to take cognizance
of his crimes, and has not condescended to
humiliate himself before you, whom he has
troubled and offended more than can be told.
He is not, therefore, capable of receiving any
grace by law or reason; nor worthy of being
admitted to your presence, and having any
favours shown to him or to his dependants
and friends. He should have presented himself
before you in all humility and contrition for
his offences; whereas he has done precisely the
contrary, and has so obstinately persisted in
his wickedness that he has had the boldness to
avow to yourself publicly, and before so great
an assembly as met at Chartres, that he put
your only brother to death for your welfare
and that of the state.</p>

<p>‘He wishes also to maintain, that you
told him you were not displeased that it had
been done. This has shocked every loyal ear
that has heard it, and will shock still more the
generations to come, who shall read and learn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
that a king of France (the greatest monarch in
Christendom) should not have been displeased
at the most inhuman and traitorous murder of
his only brother.</p>

<p>‘This is so manifestly treason of the
deepest die against your own honour, and that
of your crown and kingdom, that scarcely any
punishments ordered by law and justice are
capable of making reparation for it. It is also
greatly prejudicial to the far-famed justice of
your courts of law.</p>

<p>‘Notwithstanding the excuses which he
made to you, that the murder of your brother
had been committed for your personal security,
and the good of your kingdom, it is notorious,
that it had been plotted a very long time,
through his immeasurable ambition of obtaining
the government of your realm, as I have before
stated. He has declared to several of his
dependants and officers, that there never before
was committed in this country so base a murder;
and yet, in his defence, he says it was done for
the public good, and for your personal safety.</p>

<p>‘It is therefore very clear, according to
law and equity, that every thing done at
Chartres on that day is null and void; and
what perhaps is as deserving of punishment as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
the commission of the crime itself is, that he
never deigned to pay you any honour, respect,
or condolence for such a loss as that of your
brother, nor ever once solicited pardon, or any
remission for his offence whatever. And he
wishes to maintain, that without confessing
his guilt, and without demanding pardon, you
have remitted all further proceedings against
him, which is contrary to all equity and written
laws,&mdash;a mere illusion, or rather a derision of
justice, namely, thus to leave a murderer,
without taking any cognizance of his crime,
without penitence or contrition, and to
prosecute no inquiry into his conduct, and,
what is worse, when such a criminal obstinately
perseveres in his wickedness, even in the
presence of his sovereign lord. On that
same day, however, he fell into a manifest
and apparent contradiction; for he says that
he has done well, and consequently he assumes
to himself merit, and requires remuneration,&mdash;and,
nevertheless, he pretends to say that you
have given him pardon and remission, which
circumstance implies not good deeds and merit,
but a crime and offence.</p>

<p>‘He has never offered any prayers for the
salvation of the soul of the deceased, nor any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
remuneration to those who have suffered from
the loss caused by him; and this you ought
not, and cannot in any manner pardon.</p>

<p>‘Thus it clearly appears, that what was
done at Chartres was contrary to every principle
of law, equity, reason and justice; whence it
again follows, that from this, and other causes
too long to be detailed, all the proceedings at
Chartres are null and of no effect. Should
any one maintain, that the treaty made at
Chartres is good and binding, it may very
easily be shown, that this aforesaid traitor has
infringed the articles of it in various ways, and
has been the first to violate it.</p>

<p>‘Although you had ordered, that
henceforth he should in no way act to our
prejudice, and although he had sworn to
observe it,&mdash;nevertheless he did directly the
contrary; for, thinking to damn the good
fame of our very redoubted lord and father,
he caused your grand master of the household,
whose soul may God receive! to be arrested,
thrown into close imprisonment, and inhumanly
tortured, so that his limbs were broken, and
made him suffer other martyrdom that he
might, through the severity of torture, force
him to confess that our ever-to-be-regretted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
lord and father, and your only brother, whose
soul may God pardon! was guilty of some
of the charges which he had falsely brought
against him, so that his crimes might be
excused, and that he might for ever destroy
the honour of our family.</p>

<p>‘He had the grand master carried to the
place of execution, who there, when death was
before his eyes, declared, on the damnation of
his soul if he told a falsehood, that he had
never in his life seen any thing treasonable in
the conduct of the late duke of Orleans, or
any thing that tended to the hurt of any
individual,&mdash;but that he had always most
loyally served you: and should he have said
any thing to the contrary when under torture,
it must have been his sufferings that forced
him to utter what he thought would please
his tormentors. What he now said was the
real truth, and he uttered it on the peril of
damnation; and this he persevered in to the
moment of his execution, in the hearing of
many knights and other respectable persons.</p>

<p>‘This plainly demonstrates, that the duke
of Burgundy’s conduct was precisely the reverse
to what he had sworn to observe when at
Chartres.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<p>‘He has received into his h&ocirc;tel and
supported, and continues daily so to do, the
murderers who slew your brother, although
they were especially excepted out of the treaty
concluded at Chartres. He likewise, as is
notorious, troubles the officers and servants of
our late lord and father, who now appertain
to us, and dismisses them from all the
employments which they held under your
government, without any other cause whatever
but his hatred to us and to our house, and to
those servants who are attached to us. He
even attempted not only to ruin them in their
fortunes, but to take away their lives by
means too tedious to relate; but the facts are
notorious.</p>

<p>‘The traitor, therefore, sensible of the
horror of his criminal cruelty, and that he
could not by any means palliate it, has usurped
the government of your kingdom (for the sole
cause of his murdering your brother was his
unbounded ambition),&mdash;and, by so doing,
effectually prevents your officers of justice
from taking cognizance of his crimes, and
likewise creates infinite grief to all your loyal
subjects and wellwishers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

<p>‘He detains your royal person, as well
as that of my lord the duke of Acquitaine, in
such subjection that no one, however high his
rank, can have access to you, whatever may
be his business, without first having obtained
permission from those whom he has placed
around you, and has thus driven from you
and your family several faithful and valiant
servants long attached to you, and filled their
places with his own creatures, and in great
part with foreigners and persons unknown to
you. In like manner, he has acted toward
my lord of Acquitaine.</p>

<p>‘He has also displaced your officers,&mdash;in
particular, such as held the principal posts in
your realm; and as for your finances, he has
lavished them here and there according to
his will and pleasure, but greatly to his own
advantage, and not at all for the good of
yourself, or for the relief of your people,
which has caused much discontent against
you. The underlings in office he has sorely
vexed, under feigned pretences of justice, and
has robbed them of their fortunes, which he
has applied to his own proper use, as is well
known throughout Paris and elsewhere.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>‘In short, he has introduced such a
licentiousness of manners into the kingdom
that all sorts of crimes are committed, without
inquiry or punishment following them; and
thus, from default or neglect of justice being
done on this enormous and detestable murderer,
many other murders have been committed with
impunity in different parts of the realm, since
the melancholy death of our much-regretted
lord and father, murderers and other criminals
saying, ‘Our crimes will be passed over, since
no notice has been taken of him who slew the
king’s brother.’</p>

<p>‘On this account, most redoubted lord,
my lord of Berry your uncle, the duke of
Bourbon, the count d’Alen&ccedil;on, the counts
de Clermont and d’Armagnac, and I Charles
of Orleans, wishing to testify our loyalty to
you, as we are bound by parentage, and
being your very humble subjects, had intended
coming to you last year to lay before you the
damnable government of your kingdom, and
to remonstrate, that should it continue longer,
it must end in the destruction of yourself, your
family, and your realm.</p>

<p>‘In order, therefore, that you may hear
us as well as such as may maintain the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
contrary, let there be chosen a sufficient
number of discreet men to examine into the
grievances we complain of; and let a remedy
be applied to them, providing first for the
security of your royal person, and for that
of my lord of Acquitaine. This was more
fully explained in the proclamations issued
previously to our coming to Paris, when, for
our personal safety, we were accompanied by
our friends and vassals, all of them your subjects;
and our only object in thus coming was the
welfare of yourself and your kingdom.</p>

<p>‘We offered to wait on you with very few
attendants, but we could never obtain access
to you, nor have a single audience, through
the obstructions of this traitor, who was alway
by your side; and he alone prevented the
goodness of our intentions being made known
to you, from his persevering ambition and his
boundless desire of seizing the government of
yourself and realm.</p>

<p>‘We, therefore, finding all hopes of seeing
you fruitless, in consequence of agreements
concluded with your council, returned home;
but to avoid, if possible, the destruction of
your country, we must again confederate.&mdash;We
faithfully observed all the articles of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
agreement; but we were no sooner at a distance
than our enemy violated them in the most
essential part. It had been settled that your
new ministry should be composed of men of
unblemished characters, who were not partisans
or servants, or pensioners to either side; but he
has kept those that were attached to him in
power, so that he has now a majority in the
council, and consequently rules more despotically
and more securely than when he held the reins
of government in his own hand.</p>

<p>‘These grievances are increasing, and
will increase, unless God shall direct your
mind to provide a remedy to them.</p>

<p>‘Pierre des Essars, who had been provost
of your good town of Paris, and minister of
finance, was to be deprived of these offices,
and of every employment he held under your
name. This was done for a short time,&mdash;but
he has since obtained for him, by letters sealed
with your great seal, a re-appointment to the
provostship, under pretence of which the said
Pierre des Essars has returned to Paris, and
has attempted by force to execute the duties of
that office. He came, in fact, to the court of
the Ch&acirc;telet, seated himself on the judgment
seat, and took possession of his office with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
the knowledge and connivance of the duke
of Burgundy,&mdash;and it was not his fault, if he
failed in success.</p>

<p>‘Hence it appears plainly, that the late
arrangements have been by him, and those of
his party, violated; and that he never had any
real intentions of keeping the treaty is clear
from his having consented to the dismission of
Pierre des Essars, and then secretly procuring
his restitution. It was also stipulated in this
treaty, that all who had been deprived of their
offices for having been in the company of me,
Charles d’Orleans, and the other lords, at the
h&ocirc;tel of Winchester, should be restored to
them; and that, by your orders, and those of
your council, sir John de Charencieres was to
be replaced in his government of your town
and castle of Caen,&mdash;nevertheless, the duke
of Burgundy, in opposition to these your
orders, had him displaced, and solicited the
appointment for himself, from hatred to sir
John de Charencieres, and, having obtained it,
now holds it, which is another infringement of
the treaty.</p>

<p>‘Notwithstanding, most redoubted lord
and sovereign, all the diligence and exertions
made by our much-loved mother, whose soul
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
may God pardon! to obtain justice on the
murderers of our late very dear father, four
years have now elapsed without any judgment
being passed on such enormous criminals,
although she pursued every means in her
power.</p>

<p>‘In consequence of this failure or neglect,
I, Charles of Orleans, have of late most humbly
supplicated you to grant me warrants against
these aforesaid murderers, addressed to all your
justices, that they might, on due examination
of the charges, imprison and punish, according
to the exigency of the case, all or any who may
have been implicated in this abominable crime.
In this I made not any extraordinary request;
for justice is due to all your subjects, and cannot
be refused them: you cannot believe that any
man, however low his rank, in your kingdom,
would have a similar request neglected by your
courts of justice, for I know it could not be
refused. However, in spite of every exertion
I could make, I have never yet been able to
obtain these warrants, the reason of which is,
as I suppose, that some of your new ministers
are implicated in the crime I am anxious to
have punished, and therefore will not suffer
such warrants to be issued.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>‘For this reason, therefore, most redoubted
lord, have I of late earnestly supplicated you,
that you would, from personal considerations,
and for the good of your realm, dismiss from
your service the persons named in my letter,&mdash;for
I therein charged them with having
obstructed public justice and disturbed the
peace of the country. When this should be
done, I declared to your ambassadors, that
I was willing, from my love to your person
and attachment to your kingdom, to make
publicly known my future intentions, and that
my conduct should be such as would have
the approbation of God and of your majesty;
but notwithstanding this, I have not yet had
any satisfactory answer to all my repeated
solicitations for justice on the murderers of
my late regretted lord and father.</p>

<p>‘We, therefore, most redoubted lord,
again make our petitions that the aforesaid
criminals may be brought to that justice
which is due to them for the enormity of
their offences; the principal having made a
public confession of his guilt in the presence
of my lord of Acquitaine, who presided, in
your absence, at the meeting held at his request
in the h&ocirc;tel de St Pol, and before a numerous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
body of the nobility, clergy and others; and
the traitor cannot deny that this his confession
was made before a competent judge, and in the
presence of such witnesses as the king of Sicily
and my lord of Berry your uncle.</p>

<p>‘He had before privately confessed to
these two persons, that he had committed the
murder without any cause whatever, but
through the instigation of the enemy of
mankind. This confession, according to
every law, ought to be to his prejudice, nor
should he be suffered to offer any excuse in
extenuation of a crime thus publicly and
privately avowed; for he has condemned
himself, and ought to have judgment passed
on him accordingly.</p>

<p>‘It is very apparent, that such confession
requires not any further proceedings but the
passing of that sentence which the enormity
of the crime deserves. Notwithstanding this,
our much-regretted lady-mother and ourselves
have never been able, with all our exertions, to
overcome the premeditated delays to obstruct
justice; for three years and a half are elapsed
since we first brought the matter before you,
and we are not one step more advanced to the
attainment of judgment than we were then.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
It is painful to consider what may be the
consequence of this wilful delay of justice to
the welfare of your kingdom, and that the
most dangerous consequences may ensue, unless
a speedy and decisive remedy be applied.</p>

<p>‘May it therefore please your grace to do
your loyal duty, in executing this act of justice,
in obedience to God your Creator, to whom
judgment appertains, and from whom you hold
your authority. Have regard also to the good
government of your realm, and exert yourself
to put an end to every obstacle in the way of
a just punishment on the traitor. We most
earnestly supplicate you to comply with this
our request as soon as possible, for we are
bounden to press you to it, to the utmost of
our powers, under pain of not being reputed
the children of our late lamented father, and
of being disgraced, and unworthy of bearing
his name and arms, and of succeeding to his
honours and estates: such dishonour we will
never endure, but would rather suffer death, as
ought to be the determination of every man of
noble heart, of whatever rank or estate he
may be.</p>

<p>‘We therefore entreat you, with all
possible humility, that for this purpose, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
also in order to resist and oppose his wicked
intention to destroy us by any means whatsoever,
it may please you, from your benignant grace,
to aid, assist and abet by your power, us to
whom God hath vouchsafed so great favour
as to cause us to be born your relations, even
of your own kin, and your true nephews,
children of your only brother,&mdash;or, to speak
more properly, assist your only brother, who
has fallen a martyr to the ambitious views of
this traitor. Most redoubted lord, there is no
man so poor, who, having had his brother
murdered, will not prosecute the murderer to
death, and the more earnestly as the criminal
displays greater obstinacy. This is exemplified
in the conduct of our traitor; for it is
notorious, that he has dared to write, and to
declare to many respectable persons, that he
slew your brother, whom God pardon! our
much-redoubted lord and father, fairly and
meritoriously. In answer to which, I Charles
of Orleans say, that he lies, and I at present
decline to make a more ample reply,&mdash;for it is
very manifest, as I have before explained, that
he is a liar, and a false disloyal traitor, and
that, through the grace of God, I am, and ever
will be without reproach, and a teller of truth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>‘Since, therefore, such things cannot fail
of being very prejudicial to your realm and
to the public welfare, we beseech you most
humbly to do us that justice which you are
bounden to do, and to assist us by every means
in your power, that we may have full and
ample reparation for the wrongs done us and
our family, and that this murder may be
punished in the manner it deserves. In acting
thus, you will acquit yourself toward God our
Creator, and execute justice, of which you are
the supreme head, to whom we must have
recourse after God.</p>

<p>‘That you, our most redoubted lord, may
be assured that the contents of this letter are
from our free will and knowledge, we, Charles,
Philip and John, your most humble children
and nephews, have each of us signed it with
our own hands. Written at Gergeau, the 10th
day of July, in the year 1411.’</p>

<p>This letter was sent, by a herald of the
duke of Orleans, to the king at Paris, and was
laid before the whole of the council, where
different opinions were held as to the contents.
Some wished that the brothers should have
their requests complied with, and that the
duke of Burgundy should be summoned, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
they might hear what he had to say in his
defence to the charges which they should make
against him. But at length the business was
postponed, and the duke of Orleans could not
obtain any favourable answer; for the greater
part of those who ruled the king and the duke
of Acquitaine were favourers of the duke of
Burgundy, to whom they shortly after sent
a copy of the above letter.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy, on reading it,
was convinced that the family of Orleans
and their friends would very soon declare war
against him; and in consequence, he immediately
began to make every preparation to oppose them,
by forming magazines of stores, and engaging
a numerous body of men at arms, in various
parts of his possessions.</p>

<p>The duke of Orleans and his brothers had
not only written to the king of France, and to
the princes of the blood, but also to the principal
towns, making complaint against the duke of
Burgundy, and requiring their support. When
they perceived that the king and his ministers
did not intend to answer their letter, they again
wrote to the great towns, giving them to
understand, that if redress were not granted
them in the legal manner, as they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
demanded it, they should seek other means of
obtaining it.</p>

<p>It was now ordered by the king, the queen,
and the duke of Berry, and others of weight in
the council, that measures should be adopted
for appeasing the quarrels of the dukes of
Orleans and of Burgundy. Ambassadors were
sent to each of the parties, but without success,
principally because the duke of Burgundy
would not condescend to make any other
reparation than what had passed at the treaty
of Chartres; and his pride was increased by
having the king and the duke of Acquitaine
on his side.</p>

<p>The Orleans-party were much discontented,
but not dismayed; for many very considerable
lords were with them, and had promised them
aid and support against the duke of Burgundy
to the utmost of their powers. The queen,
therefore, and the others employed to negotiate
a peace between the two factions, finding their
attempts fruitless, gave it up, and on a certain
day made a report to the king of what
they had done, and the answers they had
received from both parties. Shortly after,
the duke of Orleans and his faction resolved
to make mortal war on the duke of Burgundy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
and his allies, and sent him their challenges by
a herald.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">When</span> the duke of Burgundy was convinced
that he could not avoid war with the family of
Orleans and their adherents, for several of them
had challenged him by letters and otherwise, he
vigorously applied himself to collect forces to

sir Mansart du Bos, a knight of Picardy, than
with any of the rest; but of him, and his end,
more shall be said hereafter.</p>

<p>He wrote a letter to the duke of Bourbon,
which he sent by Flanders king at arms, the
contents of which were as follow:</p>

<p>‘Very dear and well-beloved cousin, duke
of Bourbon and count of Clermont,&mdash;John
duke of Burgundy, count of Artois, Flanders
and Burgundy, hopes he remains well in your
good memory. In the year 1405, you and he
formed certain alliances, which, three years ago,
were, at your request, renewed and again sworn
to, in the presence of many knights and of other
persons well deserving credit. In consequence,
you were to remain my good and true friend
during your life, to promote to the utmost my
welfare and honour, and to ward off any evil
from me, as a sincere relation is bound to do;
and likewise, whenever any thing should affect
my own honour, or that of my friends, you
were bound to assist them or me, to the utmost
of your abilities, in council or in arms, and to
aid me with money and vassals against all the
world, excepting only the persons of my lord
the king and of my lord of Acquitaine, or
whoever may succeed to the throne of France,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
and of my late fair cousin, the duke of Bourbon,
your father.</p>

<p>‘Should it have happened that a war took
place between me and any enemy, whose side
the late duke of Bourbon embraced, in that
case you might have joined your late father,
but only during the course of his life, without
any way derogating from the articles of our
said alliance. Now, as we both have most
solemnly sworn to the observance of this
alliance on the holy evangelists of God, and
on sacred relics touched by us, to the damnation
of our souls in case of failure, I inform you,
very dear and well-beloved cousin, that
Charles, who calls himself duke of Orleans,
in conjunction with Philip and John, his
brothers, have sent me a challenge, and
intend to wage war on me to the utmost of
their power; but I hope, through the will of
God, and the assistance of my friends and
allies, in council and in arms, and with the
aid of my subjects and vassals, to make a
successful defence of my honour against their
attempts.</p>

<p>‘And since, very dear and well-beloved
cousin, you have so solemnly bound yourself
to assist me on every lawful occasion, I now,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
therefore, in virtue of this alliance, require
and summon you to come personally to my
aid, attended by as many of your friends and
men at arms as you can collect, in opposition
to the aforesaid Charles, Philip and John, and
thus honourably acquit yourself of your oaths
and promises,&mdash;knowing, at the same time,
that on a similar occasion I would accomplish
every article of my oaths, without any fraud

<p>This letter was delivered by the aforesaid
herald to the duke of Bourbon, who, having
fully read and considered its contents, replied
to the herald, that he would speedily send his
answer to the duke of Burgundy. This he
did; for in a few days he returned the articles
of confederation, which he had formed with
the duke of Burgundy, declaring them annulled,
and strictly united himself to the duke of Orleans

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke of Burgundy, fearful that many
of his friends would desert him, in obedience
of the royal proclamation which had been
made in every town and bailiwick through
France, strictly commanding all persons
whatever not to interfere, or in any manner to
assist the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy in
their quarrels with each other, wrote letters to
the bailiff of Amiens, to his lieutenant, and the
mayor and sheriffs of that place, and to each of
them, the contents of which were as follows:</p>

<p>‘Very dear and well-beloved,&mdash;we have
heard from several of the declaration of my
lord the king, by which you are forbidden, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
well as all his other subjects, to arm in our
defence, or in that of our adversaries. This
proclamation has been issued by our lord the
king, because he was very desirous of establishing
peace and concord between us and our enemies;
and for this purpose he had many times sent
his ambassadors as well to them as to us, to
which we have alway replied like a true and
loyal subject and servant; and, through God’s
mercy, all our answers have tended to a good
end, and to peace and union, which has made
them perfectly agreeable to our lord the king.
But our adversaries having persisted in the
same damnable and wicked purposes, which
they have ever followed against the peace of
my lord the king, his noble family, and the
public welfare, by continuing to tread in the
footsteps of their father, who, for a long time,
persevered in his intentions of destroying my
lord the king and his family, have acted
quite contrariwise, and sent answers full of
dissimulation and treachery, with the sole
design of gaining time.</p>

<p>‘Whilst our much-redoubted lady the
queen of France, our very dear lord and uncle
the duke of Berry, and our very dear brother
the duke of Brittany, were endeavouring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
according to the king’s orders, to negotiate a
peace between us and our adversaries, these
false and disloyal traitors, and disobedient
subjects, Charles, who calls himself duke of
Orleans, and his brothers, sent to us their
challenges, and, before that time, have often
scandalously, and in violation of their oaths,
defamed our person and character as they had
before done. This, however, under God’s
pleasure, will fail in having any effect, for he
who knows all hearts is acquainted with the
steady love and attachment we bear, and shall
bear so long as we live, to our lord the king
and to his family, and to the welfare of his
kingdom; and we shall ever support the same
with all the worldly possessions and powers
that God has bestowed upon us.</p>

<p>‘With these views we have done and
commanded such acts as have been done,
without paying regard to the scandalous
defamations that have been thrown out
against us, or any way fearing a diminution of
honour by such false, wicked, and disobedient
traitors to our lord the king, as the aforesaid
Charles and his brothers, the issue of that
infamous traitor, their father, so notorious
throughout the realm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>‘In truth, we hold it not to have been the
intention of our lord the king to prevent any
of our relatives, friends, allies, subjects, and
well-inclined vassals, from joining us, in the
defence of our honour, against our enemies,
and to defend our countries from invasion.</p>

<p>‘We therefore entreat of you, and require
most affectionately, that you will please to
allow such as may be inclined to serve us, who
live within your bailiwick, and all others of
our friends who may travel through it, to pass
freely without any molestation whatever; for
you may be assured, that what we shall do will
be for the welfare and security of my lord the
king, his family, and the whole kingdom, to
the confusion of all disloyal traitors.</p>

do to give you pleasure, you have but to signify
it to us, and we will do it with our whole heart.&mdash;Very
dear and good friends, may the Holy
Spirit have you under his care! Written in our

<p class="hang">THE PARISIANS TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE
ARMAGNACS.&mdash;A CIVIL WAR BREAKS OUT
IN SEVERAL PARTS OF FRANCE.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">At</span> this time the king of France, who had
for a considerable time enjoyed good health,
relapsed into his former disorder; on which
account, and by reason of the discontents
that prevailed throughout the kingdom, (the
seat of government had been transferred to
Melon,) the butchers of Paris, who have
greater power and privileges than any other
trade, suspecting that the government of
the realm, through the intrigues of the queen
and the provost of merchants, named Charles
Cudane, would be given to the dukes of Berry
and Brittany, in preference to the duke of
Acquitaine, the king’s eldest son, waited upon
the latter, and exhorted him, notwithstanding
his youth, to assume the government for the
good of the king and kingdom, promising him
their most loyal aid until death. The duke of
Acquitaine inclined to their request, and granted
them their wishes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

<p>This done, they ordered it to be proclaimed
by sound of trumpet in all the squares of Paris,
that the provost of merchants, and others in
Paris, who were numerous, and whom they
suspected of being favourable to the dukes of
Berry, Bourbon, and Brittany, and to their
parties, must quit the town before a fixed day,
under pain of suffering death. In consequence
of this proclamation, twelve persons, men and
women, without including the domestics of the
above lords, left Paris; and shortly after, the
duke of Brittany, hearing of these commotions,
took leave of the queen at Melun and retired
into his duchy.</p>

<p>The butchers, and those who lived near
the market-places, with the greater part of the
Parisians, were strong partisans of the duke of
Burgundy, and very desirous that only he, or
those that were of his party, should govern the
kingdom; and, to say the truth, it was now
become dangerous for the nobility, of whatever
party they might be, to dwell in Paris, for
the common people had great sway in its
government.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the duke of Orleans
and his allies were strengthening themselves,
by every means in their power, with men at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
arms. The duke of Bourbon and the count
d’Alen&ccedil;on came in these days with a numerous
body before the town of Roye in the Vermandois,
which belongs to the king of France, and
entered it about mid-day, more through fraud
than by force of arms, for the townsmen did
not suspect any warfare. When they had
dined, they sent for the principal inhabitants,
and ordered them, whether it were pleasing to
them or otherwise, to receive a garrison from
them. They then rode to Nesle, in the
Vermandois, belonging to the count de
Dammartin, wherein they also placed a
garrison.</p>

<p>Thence they dispatched sir Clugnet de
Brabant, who had joined them, sir Manessier
Guieret, and other captains well attended, to
the town of Ham in the Vermandois, belonging
to the duke of Orleans: they returned by Chauni
sur Oise, where they also left a garrison, and
in many other places, as well belonging to
themselves as to others attached to their
party.</p>

<p>The duke of Bourbon, on his arrival
from this expedition at his town of Clermont,
strengthened it, and all his other towns in that
country, with fortifications. When the garrisons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
had been properly posted, the war suddenly
broke out between the two parties of Armagnacs
and Burgundians.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy had not been idle
in fortifying his towns with garrisons, and in
collecting men at arms to resist his adversaries:
he himself was in Flanders making preparations
to march an army to offer them battle. The
army of the Armagnacs had already made
incursions into Artois, and had done much
mischief to friend and foe, by carrying off
prisoners and great plunder to the garrisons
whence they had come. The Burgundians
were not slow in making reprisals, and
frequently invaded the county of Clermont
and other parts.</p>

<p>When by chance the two parties met,
the one shouted ‘Orleans!’ and the other
‘Burgundy!’ and thus from this accursed
war, carried on in different parts, the country
suffered great tribulation.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy, however, had
the king on his side, and those also who
governed him: he resided in his h&ocirc;tel of
St Pol in Paris, and the greater part of its
inhabitants were likewise attached to the duke
of Burgundy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>At that time, the governors of Paris
were Waleran count de St Pol and John of
Luxembourg<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>, his nephew, who was very
young, Enguerrand de Bournouville, and
other captains. They frequently made sallies,
well accompanied by men at arms, on the
Armagnacs, who at times even advanced to
the gates of Paris. They were particularly
careful in guarding the person of the king,
to prevent him from being seduced by the
Orleans-party, and carried out of the town.</p>

<p class="hang">SIR CLUGNET DE BRABANT IS NEAR TAKING
RETHEL.&mdash;HE OVERRUNS THE COUNTRY OF
BURGUNDY.&mdash;OTHER TRIBULATIONS ARE
NOTICED.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Sir</span> Clugnet de Brabant, who always styled
himself admiral of France, one day assembled
two thousand combatants, or thereabout, whom
he marched as speedily as he could from their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
different garrisons, to the country of the
Rethelois, having with them scaling ladders
and other warlike machines. They arrived
at the ditches of the town of Rethel about
sun-rise, and instantly made a very sharp
assault, thinking to surprise the garrison and
plunder the town. The inhabitants, however,
had received timely notice of their intentions,
and had prepared themselves for resistance
as speedily as they could.&mdash;Nevertheless, the
assault lasted a considerable time with much
vigour on both sides, insomuch that many
were killed and wounded of each party.</p>

<p>Among the latter was sir Clugnet de
Brabant, who, judging from the defence
which was made, that he could not gain
the place, ordered the retreat to be sounded;
and his men marched into the plain, carrying
with them the dead and wounded. He then
divided them into two companies; the one of
which marched through the country of the
Laonnois to Coucy and Chauni, plundering
what they could lay hands on, and making all
prisoners whom they met on their retreat.</p>

<p>The other company marched through
part of the empire, by the county of Guise,
passing through the Cambresis, and driving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
before them, like the others, all they could
find, especially great numbers of cattle, and
thus returned to the town of Ham sur Somme
and to their different garrisons.</p>

<p>When they had reposed themselves for
eight days, they again took the field with six
thousand combatants, and marched for the
county of Artois. They came before the
town of Bapaume, belonging to the duke
of Burgundy, and, on their arrival, won the
barriers, and advanced to the gates, where
there was a severe skirmish. But the lord de
Heilly, sir Hugh de Busse, the lord d’Ancuelles
and other valiant men at arms, who had been
stationed there by the duke of Burgundy, made
a sally, and drove them beyond the barriers,&mdash;when
many gallant deeds were done, and several
killed and wounded on both sides; but the
Burgundians were forced to retire within the
town, for their enemies were too numerous for
them to attempt any effectual resistance. The
Orleans-party now retreated, and collected
much plunder in the adjacent country, which
they carried with them to their town of Ham.</p>

<p>During this time, sir James de Chastillon<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>,
and the other ambassadors from the king of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
France, negotiated a truce at Leulinghen, in
the Boulonois, with the english ambassadors,
to last for one year on sea and land.</p>

<p>While these things were passing, the duke
of Berry came with the queen of France from
Melun to Corbeil, and thence sent Louis of
Bavaria to the duke of Acquitaine in Paris,
and to those who governed the king, and also
to the butchers, to request that they would be
pleased to allow him to attend the queen to
Paris, and to reside in his h&ocirc;tel of Neele, near
to the king his nephew, since he was determined
no way to interfere in the war between the dukes
of Orleans and Burgundy.</p>

<p>But his request was refused, chiefly owing
to the butchers of Paris, and others of the
commonalty, who had great weight; and that
he might give over all thoughts of coming,
they broke every door and window of his h&ocirc;tel
de Neele, and committed other great damages.
They sent back the queen’s brother with a
message to her, to come and reside with her
lord at Paris, without delay, but not to bring
the duke of Berry with her.</p>

<p>The Parisians, fearful that the king and
the duke of Acquitaine might be carried off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
from the h&ocirc;tel of St Pol, made them reside
at the Louvre, where they kept constant guard
day and night, to prevent any attempts of the
Orleans-party to carry them away.</p>

<p>The queen, on receiving the message by
her brother from the Parisians, and suspecting
the consequences of their commotions, set out
from Corbeil, and returned to Melun with him
and the duke of Berry. A few days after, the
Parisians took up arms, marched in a large
body to Corbeil, took the town, and placed
a garrison therein. They then broke down all
the bridges over the Seine, between Charenton
and Melun, that the Armagnacs might not pass
the river and enter the island of France.</p>

<p>While the queen and the duke of Berry
were at Melun, with the count Waleran de
St Pol, whom the marshal Boucicaut had
sent thither, the master of the cross-bows
and the grand master of the household came
to them with few attendants. The duke of
Bourbon and the count d’Alen&ccedil;on, on their
road from the Vermandois and Beauvoisis, to
join the duke of Orleans, who was assembling
his troops in the G&acirc;tinois, called on the queen
and the duke of Berry, to require their aid and
support against the duke of Burgundy, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
was not granted,&mdash;because the king in full
council, presided by the duke of Acquitaine,
had just published an edict in very strong
terms, and had caused it to be sent to all the
bailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom,
ordering all nobles, and others that were
accustomed to bear arms, to make themselves
ready to serve the king, in company with John
duke of Burgundy, and to aid him in driving
out of his realm all traitorous and disobedient
subjects, commanding them to obey the duke of
Burgundy the same as himself, and ordering all
towns and passes to be opened to him, and to
supply him with every necessary provision and
store, the same as if he were there in person.
On this proclamation being issued, very many
made preparations to serve under the duke of
Burgundy with all diligence. In addition, the
duke of Acquitaine wrote the duke letters in his
own hand, by which he ordered all the men
at arms dependant on the crown to serve
personally against his cousin-german, the duke
of Orleans, and his allies, who, as he said, were
wasting the kingdom in many different parts,
desiring him to advance as speedily as he could
toward Senlis and the island of France.

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHAP_XXXIV">CHAP. XXXIV.</h2>

<p class="hang">THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES A LARGE
ARMY TO LAY SIEGE TO THE TOWN OF HAM,
AND LEADS THITHER HIS FLEMINGS.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke of Burgundy, being now assured
that the duke of Orleans and his allies were
raising a large force to invade his countries,
and that they had already placed garrisons in
towns and fortresses belonging to him or his
allies, whence they had made frequent inroads
to the despoiling of his country, was highly
discontented. To oppose them, he had sent
his summons to all his territories in Burgundy,
Artois and Flanders, and elsewhere, for all
nobles, and others accustomed to bear arms in
his behalf, to prepare themselves to join him
with all speed, well accoutred and armed, in
obedience to the king’s commands, and to
oppose his and the king’s enemies.</p>

<p>He also solicited the assistance of his good
towns in Flanders, and requested that they
would powerfully exert themselves in his
favour, to which they readily and liberally
assented. They raised a body of forty or fifty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
thousand combatants, well armed and provided
with staves according to the custom of the
country. They had twelve thousand carriages,
as well carts as cars, to convey their armour,
baggage and artillery, and a number of very
large cross-bows, called ribaudequins, placed
on two wheels, each having a horse to draw it.
They had also machines for the attack of towns,
behind which were long iron spits, to be used
toward the close of a battle,&mdash;and on each
of them was mounted one or two pieces of
artillery.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy had also summoned
to his assistance the duke of Brabant, his brother,
who attended him with a handsome company;
as did likewise a valiant english knight, named
sir William Baldock, lieutenant of Calais, with
about three hundred english combatants.</p>

<p>Their places of rendezvous were at the
towns of Douay and Arras, and the adjacent
country. The duke of Burgundy, on quitting
Douay with his brother of Brabant and great
multitudes of men of rank, advanced to Sluys,
belonging to the count de la Marche, where
he lodged. On the morrow, the first day of
September, he marched away early, and fixed
his quarters on the plain near to Marcouin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
where he had his tents and pavilions pitched,
and waited there two days for the arrival of
his whole army, and particularly for his
Flemings, who came in grand parade, and
drew up to their quarters in handsome array.&mdash;So
numerous were their tents that their
encampments looked like large towns; and
in truth, when all were assembled, they
amounted to sixty thousand fighting men,
without including the varlets, and such like,
who were numberless,&mdash;and the whole country
resounded with the noises they made.</p>

<p>With regard to the Flemings, they thought
that no towns or fortresses could withstand
them; and the duke of Burgundy was obliged,
on their setting off, to abandon to them whatever
they might conquer; and when they went from
one quarter to another, they were commonly
all fully armed, and in companies, according
to the different towns and the custom of
Flanders,&mdash;and even when they marched on
foot, the greater part wore leg-armour.</p>

<p>As to their mode of marching through a
country, whatever they could lay hands on was
seized, and, if portable, thrown into their carts;
and they were so proud, on account of their
great numbers, that they paid not any attention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
to noble men, however high their rank; and
when the army was to be quartered, or when
they were on a foraging party, they rudely
drove away other men at arms, especially if
they were not their countrymen, taking from
them whatever provision they might have
collected, or any thing else that pleased them.
This conduct created great disturbances and
quarrels, more especially among the Picards,
who would not patiently endure their rudeness,
insomuch that the duke of Burgundy and his
captains had great difficulty in keeping any
kind of peace between them.</p>

<p>The duke, after waiting some days for the
whole of his army, saw it arrive; and then he
marched off triumphantly, and in handsome
array, and fixed his quarters on the river
Scheldt, near to the town of Marcouin.</p>

<p>On the morrow, he advanced to Mouchi
la Garhe, between Peronne and Ham, and
halted there. At this place, a Fleming was
hanged for stealing a chalice and other valuables
from a church. He thence marched toward
the town of Ham sur Somme, where his
enemies were.</p>

<p>On his approach to the town of Athies,
belonging to the count de Dammartin, one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
his adversaries, the inhabitants were so terrified
that they came out in a body to present him
with the keys of the gates, on the condition of
being secured from pillage. The duke liberally
granted their request, seeing they had thus
humbled themselves before him of their own
free will, and gave them a sufficient force to
guard their town from being any way molested.&mdash;&mdash;The
duke then advanced with his army
near to Ham, but sent forward some of his best
light troops to observe the countenance of the
enemy. The Orleans-party sallied out against
them, and a sharp skirmish took place; but
they were compelled, by the superior number
of the Burgundians, to retire within the town.
The next day he marched his whole army
before the place in battle-array, and had his
tents pitched on an eminence in front of one
of the gates, and about the distance of a
cannon shot. The Flemings were likewise
encamped according to the orders of their
marshals and leaders, during which the garrison
made some sallies, but were repulsed, in spite
of their valour, by superior numbers, and many
were killed and wounded on each side.</p>

<p>When the duke had surrounded this town
on one side only, he ordered battering machines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
to be placed against the gate and wall, to
demolish them; and the Flemings pointed
their ribaudequins, and shot from them so
continually, day and night, that the enemy
were greatly annoyed. Breaches were made
in the wall and gate within a few days; but
though the garrison was much harrassed, they
repaired both in the best manner they could,
with wood and dung.</p>

<p>At length, the besiegers fixed on a day
for a general attack on the gate, intending to
force an entry: the engagement continued very
sharp for three hours, but the garrison defended
themselves so valiantly, wounding and slaying
so many of the assailants, that they were forced
to retreat. This happened on a Thursday;
and on the Friday, the duke of Burgundy, I
know not for what reason, had it proclaimed
that no one should, on any account, make an
assault on the town, but that all should labour
in forming bridges over the Somme, that a
passage might be obtained for the army, and
that the place might be besieged on all sides,&mdash;but
events turned out very far from his
expectations.</p>

<p>On the Friday morning, the besieged
were expecting that the attack would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
renewed; but hearing of the duke’s intentions
to cross the river with his army and surround
the town, they packed up all their valuables
and fled, leaving within the walls only poor
people and peasants, who had retired thither
for safety. Those persons not having ability
or inclination to defend themselves, the duke’s
army, headed by the Picards, entered the place
without any danger. The Flemings, observing
this, rushed so impetuously to gain admittance
that many were squeezed to death. When they
had entered, they instantly began to plunder
all they could lay hands on, according to
the liberty which their lord the duke had
granted them; for, as I have said, he had been
necessitated so to do before they would march
from home. Part placed themselves on one
side of the street, leading to the gate which
they had entered, and part on the other;
and when the Picards, or others not of their
country, were returning, they stopped and
robbed them of all they had: they spared
no man, noble or otherwise; and in this riot
several were killed and wounded.</p>

<p>They entered a monastery of the town,
and took away all they could find, and carried
to their tents many of both sexes, and children;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
and, on the morrow, having seized all they had,
they set fire to several parts of the town,&mdash;and,
to conclude all, the churches and houses, with
many of the inhabitants, were burnt, as well as
a great quantity of cattle that had been driven
thither as to a place of security.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this cruel conduct of the
Flemings, six or seven of the monks escaped
from the monastery, by the assistance of some
noblemen, particularly the prior, who most
reverently held in his hands a cross, and were
conducted to the tents of the duke of Burgundy,
where they were in safety.</p>

<p>Such was the conduct of the Flemings at
the commencement of this war. There were
many towns beyond the Somme that belonged
to the duke of Orleans and his allies, who,
hearing of what had passed at Ham, were,
as it may be readily believed, in the utmost
fear and alarm; and there were few people
desirous of waiting their coming, lest they
should be besieged in some fortress, and suffer
a similar fate,&mdash;for sir Clugnet de Brabant and
sir Manessier Guieret, as I have said, had
already abandoned Ham, which was well
supplied with stores and provision, and had
retreated to Chauni and to Coucy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>The inhabitants of the town of Neelle,
belonging to the count de Dammartin, seeing
the smoke of Ham, were greatly perplexed,
for their garrison had fled; but they, following
the example of the town of Athies, waited
on the duke of Burgundy, and, with many
lamentations, presented him with the keys of
their town, offering to submit themselves to
his mercy. The duke received them into
favour, in the name of the king and his own,
on their swearing not to admit any garrison,
and to be in future true and loyal subjects to
the king, their sovereign lord.</p>

<p>This oath they willingly took; and,
having thanked the duke for his mercy, they
returned to their town, and by his orders
demolished some of their gates and many
parts of their walls. They also made their
magistrates and principal inhabitants swear to
the observance of the treaty which they had
made, and for this time they remained in
peace.</p>

<p>In like manner, those of the town of
Roye, that were but lately become subjects to
the king, sent deputies to the duke, at his
camp before Ham, to say, that the Orleans
party had treacherously entered their town,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
and had done them much mischief, but that
they had departed on hearing of his march,
and requesting he would not be displeased with
them, as they were ready to receive him, and
act according to his pleasure. The duke told
them, he should be satisfied if they would
promise, on their oaths, never to admit again
within their walls any of his adversaries of the
Orleans-party. Having obtained this answer,
they returned joyous to their town.</p>

<p>The duke now passed the Somme with
his army at Ham, leaving that town completely
ruined, and marched toward Chauni on the
Oise, belonging to the duke of Orleans; but
the garrison, hearing of it, quitted the place in
haste. The townsmen, greatly alarmed, sent,
without delay, to offer him their keys, and
humbly supplicated his mercy, saying that
their lord’s men at arms had fled on hearing
of his approach, from the fear they had of him.
The duke received them kindly, and took their
oaths, that they would henceforth loyally obey
the king their sovereign lord, and himself, and
would admit a garrison of his men to defend
the town.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of this treaty, the
duke advanced to Roye, in the Vermandois,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
and was lodged in the town, having quartered
his army in the country round it. He dispatched
thence sir Peter des Essars, knight, and his
confidential adviser, to the king of France, to
his son-in-law the duke of Acquitaine, and to
the citizens of Paris, to make them acquainted
with the strength of his army, and with his
successes. Sir Peter des Essars was honourably
received by the duke of Acquitaine and the
Parisians; and in compliment to the duke of
Burgundy, he was reinstated in his office of
provost, in the room of sir Brunelet de Sainct
Cler, who, by the royal authority, was appointed
bailiff of Senlis, on the dismission of sir Gastelius
du Bost, who was suspected of being a favourer
of the Orleans-party.</p>

<p>When sir Peter des Essars had finished the
business he had been sent on to Paris, he set out
for Rethel to announce to the count de Nevers,
who had assembled a considerable force, the
march of the duke, and to desire him to
advance to the town of Mondidier, where he
would have more certain intelligence of his
brother. The count de Nevers, on hearing
this, used all diligence to assemble his men,
and set off to join the duke.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

<p>During these transactions, the duke of
Orleans, the count d’Armagnac, the constable
of France, the master of the cross-bows, with
a large body of men at arms and others, came
to the town of Melun, where the queen of
France and the duke of Berry resided. Having
held a conference with the queen and duke,
they advanced to La Fert&egrave; on the Marne, which
belonged to sir Robert de Bar<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>, in right of his
wife the viscountess de Meaux. They crossed
the Marne, and came to Arsy en Mussien, in
the county of Valois, dependant on the duke
of Orleans, where his brother, the count de
Vertus, met him.</p>

<p>The count was accompanied by a numerous
body of combatants, among whom were the
duke of Bourbon, John son to the duke of Bar,
sir William de Coucy, Am&eacute; de Sallebruche,
sir Hugh de Hufalize, with others from the
Ardennes, Lorraine and Germany, who, in the
whole, amounted to full six thousand knights
and esquires, not including armed infantry and
bowmen; and this party was henceforward
popularly called <i>Armagnacs</i>, as I have before
observed. Each bore on his armour badges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
similar to those which they had formerly worn
when they lay before Paris.</p>

<p>The duke of Orleans marched this army
from the Valois, passing by Senlis, toward
his county of Beaumont; but Enguerrand de
Bournouville, who had been posted in Senlis
with a large force of men at arms to guard it,
sallied out on their rear, and made a good
booty of their baggage as well as prisoners.
In doing this, however, he lost some of his
men, who were slain or taken, and he then
returned to Senlis. The duke of Orleans,
with the other princes, were lodged in the
castle of Beaumont, and his army in the
country surrounding it.</p>

<p>The count de Nevers was prevented from
joining his brothers as he intended,&mdash;for the
Armagnacs, being the strongest, constrained
him to conduct his army to Paris.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy was already arrived
at Mondidier with his whole army, and was
making preparations to combat his enemies,
should they be so inclined, or to attack any
town to which they should retire, according
to his pleasure. But the Flemings were now
desirous to return home, and had demanded
permission of the duke, saying, that they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
served the time required of them on their
departure from Flanders.</p>

<p>The duke was much surprised and
displeased at their conduct, but earnestly
desired that they would stay with him for
only eight days longer, as he had received
intelligence that his enemies were near at
hand, with a great army, ready to offer him
battle, and that they could never serve him
more effectually. At this moment, the greater
part of their officers waited on the duke to
take leave of him, who, hearing the earnest
and affectionate manner in which he made so
trifling a request, resolved to go back to their
men and inform them of it, and promised to
do every thing in their power in order that it
should be complied with.</p>

<p>On their return to the tent of Ghent,
where all their councils were held, they
assembled the leaders of the commonalty,
and told them the request the duke their
lord had made, namely, that they would stay
with him only eight days more, for that his
adversaries were at hand with a large army
to offer him battle. This request having
been stated, various were the opinions of the
meeting: some were for staying, others not,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
saying they had fulfilled the term required
of them by their lord,&mdash;that winter was
approaching, when, so numerous as they
were, they could not keep the field without
great danger. Their opinions were so
discordant that no conclusion could be
formed, to enable their captains to give any
positive answer to the duke.</p>

<p>This council was held the 20th day of
September, in the afternoon; and when it
became dusk, these Flemings made very large
fires in different places, of the wood and
timber of the houses which they had pulled
down and destroyed in Mondidier. They
then began to load their baggage-waggons,
and to arm themselves; and at midnight they
all shouted from their quarters, in Flemish,
<i>Vax, vax!</i> which signifies, ‘To arms, to arms!’
and alarmed all the other parts of the army.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy was entirely
ignorant of what they intended to do, and
sent some flemish lords to know their intentions;
but they would not explain themselves to any
one, and made answers contrary to the questions
asked. During this, the night passed away;
and the moment day appeared, they harnessed
their horses to the baggage-waggons, and set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
fire to all their lodgings, shouting, ‘Gau, gau!’
and departed, taking the road to Flanders.</p>

<p>The attendants of the duke of Burgundy,
hearing this cry and clamour, went to inform
him of it in his tent. Very much astonished
thereat, he instantly mounted his horse, and,
accompanied by the duke of Brabant, rode
after them. When he had overtaken them,
with his head uncovered and his hands
uplifted, he most humbly besought them to
return, and stay with him four days only,
calling them his most trusty and well-beloved
friends and companions, offering them great
gifts, and promising to relieve the country of
Flanders from taxes for ever, if they would
comply with his wishes.</p>

<p>The duke of Brabant also remonstrated
with them on the advantages offered them by
their lord, and, as he asked in return so very
trifling a favour, entreated them to pay due
deference to his demand. But it was in vain:
they turned a deaf ear to all that was said, and
continued their march, only showing the written
agreements they had made with the duke, which
were carried before them, and which they had
fulfilled on their part; but, as they were signed
with his seal, he had not performed his, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
having them escorted beyond the river Somme
to a place of safety. Should he refuse to do
this, they would send him his only son, then
at Ghent, cut into thousands of pieces.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy, noticing their
rude manners, and perceiving that nothing
was to be gained from them by fair means,
began to appease them by ordering the
trumpets to sound for decamping. This was
not done without much loss,&mdash;for the duke,
occupied solely with the attempt to make the
Flemings change their minds, had not ordered
the tents to be struck, nor the baggage loaded,
so that the greater part of the tents were burnt,
with other things, from the fire of the houses
caused by the Flemings on their departure.
The flames spread from house to house, to
the lodgings of the duke of Burgundy, who
was troubled to the heart,&mdash;for he well knew
that his adversaries were in high spirits, a short
day’s march off, and he was anxious to give
them battle; but from this conduct of the
Flemings his intentions would be frustrated,&mdash;and
what was worse, he knew for certain, that
the moment they should hear of it, they would
publish that he had retreated, not daring to
meet them. He was, nevertheless, forced to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
submit to events which he could not foresee
nor prevent.</p>

<p>The Flemings had no sooner turned their
faces homeward but they advanced more in one
day than in three before, and whatever they
could lay hands on was pillaged and thrown
into their baggage-carts: they had, moreover,
many quarrels with the Picards and English,
and it often happened that stragglers were
wounded or put to death,&mdash;and when they
were superior in numbers, they failed not to
retaliate.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, that this retreat
took place in the month of September, when
the grapes in the vineyards were ripe; and they
robbed every vineyard they passed, devouring
so many that numbers were found dead among
the vines. On the other hand, they fed their
horses and cattle so very abundantly on the
immense pillage which they every where made,
that very many were bursten.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy, on his arrival at
Peronne with his men at arms, went personally
to thank the Flemings, who were encamped on
the river side, in the most humble manner for
their services, and then had them escorted by
his brother, the duke of Brabant, to Flanders,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
when every man returned to his home. The
magistrates of the great towns were, however,
very much displeased when they heard of
their behaviour; but they did not at the time
notice it, for there were too many of them
under arms.</p>

<p>Thus did the Flemings retreat from
Mondidier contrary to the will of their lord,
the duke of Burgundy. On the same day, a
knight of the party of the duke of Orleans,
called sir Peter de Quesnes, lord of Garois,
at the head of full two hundred combatants,
made an attack on Mondidier, about four
hours after they had marched away. He
found there many people, especially merchants,
and inhabitants of the neighbourhood, whom
he took prisoners: he slew many, and he and
his men made a very great booty.</p>

<p>He then returned to Clermont in Beauvoisis,
whither the Armagnacs had marched in pursuit
of the count de Nevers. When they heard of
this retreat of the duke of Burgundy and the
Flemings, they held a council whether or not
they should follow them into their own
country. It was at length determined by the
wisest to return toward Paris, and attempt to
gain admittance by means of some connexions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
they had there, principally in order to have
possession of the person of the king, which
was their grand object.</p>

<p>They began their march, in consequence,
towards Verberies, and crossed the river Oise
by a new bridge, which they erected, and
thence advanced for Paris. Those who had
the guard of the king and the Parisians were
not well pleased to hear of their being so near,
and made every preparation to oppose their
entrance to Paris. The Armagnacs, finding
it impossible to succeed, managed so well with
the inhabitants of St Denis that they were there
admitted; and the princes lodged in the town,
and the army in the adjacent fields and villages.
From that situation, they made a sharp war on
the town of Paris, and on all those who sided
with the king and the duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>They advanced daily from different parts
to the very gates of Paris,&mdash;when sallies
were made against them, particularly by sir
Enguerrand de Bournouville, who was one
of the chiefs of the garrison under the count
Waleran de St Pol, the governor of the town.
Severe skirmishes often took place, and many
gallant deeds were done by the men at arms of
both sides.

<h2 id="CHAP_XXXV">CHAP. XXXV.</h2>

<p class="hang">THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY ASSEMBLES ANOTHER
ARMY TO MARCH TO PARIS.&mdash;EVENTS THAT
HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">We</span> will now return to the duke of Burgundy,
who having, as I have said, dismissed his
Flemings, under the escort of his brother the
duke of Brabant, went from Peronne to Arras,
where he met the earls of Pembroke and of
Arundel, and sir William Baldock, who had
accompanied him on his late expedition. As
these earls were lately come from England, he
paid them every respect, in compliment to the
king of England who had sent them. They
had brought full twelve hundred combatants,
as well horse as foot, all men of courage.</p>

<p>Much intercourse took place at this time
between the king of England and the duke
of Burgundy, respecting a marriage between
Henry prince of Wales and one of the duke’s
daughters<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>.&mdash;After he had magnificently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
feasted these english captains in his town of
Arras, and made them handsome presents, he
ordered them to march to Peronne, and hastily
summoned men at arms from all quarters to
meet him personally at Peronne, where he
had commanded the nobles of his estates to
assemble.</p>

<p>The duke of Brabant did not meet him
this time, being detained in the county of
Luxembourg by affairs on behalf of his wife.
The duke of Burgundy left Peronne with no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
more than six thousand combatants, and
marched to Roye,&mdash;thence, by Breteuil, to
Beauvais, and from Beauvais, through Gisors,
to Pontoise, where he halted for three weeks
or thereabout. During this period, great
numbers of men at arms came from different
countries to serve him.</p>

<p>While these things were passing, it was
ordered by the royal council, in the presence
of the duke of Acquitaine, the count de
Mortain, the lord Gilles of Brittany, Waleran
count de St Pol, governor of Paris, the
chancellor of France<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>, the lord Charles de
Savoisy, and other great nobles, that certain
proclamations should be sent to all the
bailiwicks and seneschalships of the kingdom,
respecting the assembling of such large bodies
of men at arms, daily done in defiance of the
king’s orders, by the duke of Orleans, his
brothers, the duke of Bourbon, the counts
d’Alen&ccedil;on and d’Armagnac, and others of
their party, to the great mischief and tribulation
of the kingdom at large, and highly displeasing
to the king and disgraceful to his dignity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<p>This proclamation again prohibited any
one from daring to join the aforesaid nobles,
or any of their party in arms, under pain of
being reputed rebels and traitors to the king
and his realm. It likewise commanded all
that had joined them to depart without delay,
and return peaceably to their homes, without
further living on or harrassing the people, and
ordered that no hindrance should be given to
prevent this from being carried into effect.
Such as should disobey these orders would be
most rigorously prosecuted without delay as
rebels,&mdash;and from that day forth no grace or
favour would be shown them.</p>

<p>This proclamation was published in the
usual places, and some few, but in no great
number, privately quitted the party of the
Armagnacs, and returned to that of the king.
Those that were disobedient, when taken by
the royal officers, were in great danger of
their lives. Several were publicly executed;
and among them a knight, called sir Binet
d’Espineuse, attached to the duke of Bourbon
from being a native of the county of Clermont,
suffered at Paris. The cause of his death was
his having taken by force some flanders horses
that were coming as a present to the duke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
Acquitaine from the duke of Burgundy. After
he was beheaded in the market-place, his body
was suspended by the arms to the gibbet at
Montfaucon.</p>

<p>This punishment was inflicted by order
of sir Peter des Essars, who, as has been
said, was lately re-established in his office of
provost of Paris, in the room of sir Brunelet
de Sainct-Cler.</p>

<p>The duke of Orleans and his party were
indignant at this execution, as well as at
the late royal proclamation; and the duke
of Bourbon was particularly angry at the
disgraceful death of his knight.</p>

<p>Thus affairs went on from bad to worse.
One day, the duke of Orleans fixed his quarters,
with a large force, at the castle of St Ouen,
which is a royal mansion, and thence made
daily excursions to the gates of Paris. He
pressed the Parisians so hard that they were
much straitened for provisions; for they were
not as yet accustomed to war, nor had they
provided any stores or assembled a force sufficient
to repel the attacks of their adversaries.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Sens, brother to the
late grand master Montagu, had joined the
Armagnacs, but not in his pontifical robes;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
for instead of a mitre, he wore a helmet,&mdash;for
a surplice, a coat of mail,&mdash;and for a cope, a
piece of steel,&mdash;for his croisier, a battle-axe.
At this period, the duke of Orleans sent his
heralds with letters to the king and the duke
of Acquitaine, to inform them that the duke
of Burgundy had fled with his Flemings from
Mondidier, not daring to wait his nearer
approach. He took that opportunity of
writing also to some of his friends in Paris,
to know if through their means he could be
admitted into the town. It was lost labour,
for those who governed for the duke of
Burgundy were too active and attentive in
keeping the party together.</p>

<p>By some intrigues between those of the
Orleans-party and one named Colinet du
Puiseur, who was governor for the king in
the town of St Cloud, this place was given
up to them. The duke of Orleans instantly
re-garrisoned it, and continually harrassed
the Parisians; for now he could at any time
cross the Seine at the bridge of St Cloud,
and attack both sides of Paris at once. Thus
were the Parisians oppressed on all sides by
the Armagnacs,&mdash;on which account, another
proclamation was issued in the king’s name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
throughout the realm, complaining of the
continued atrocious and rebellious acts, in
spite of the positive orders of the king to
the contrary, committed by the duke of
Orleans and his allies, to the great loss and
destruction of his subjects and kingdom; that
since such grievous complaints had been made
on the subject, and were continually made,
he was resolved to have a stop put to such
lawless proceedings. The king, therefore, with
mature deliberation of council, now declares the
aforesaid family of Orleans, and their allies,
rebels, and traitors to himself and the crown
of France; and in order that henceforward
no persons may dare to join them, he declares,
all such to have forfeited their lives and estates,
and by these presents gives power and authority
to all his loyal subjects to arrest and imprison
any of the aforesaid rebels, and to seize on their
properties, moveable or immoveable, and to
drive them out of the kingdom, without let
or hindrance from any of the king’s officers.
Given at Paris, the 3d day of October, 1411.
Signed by the king, on the report from the
great council specially called for this purpose,
at the h&ocirc;tel de St Pol, when were present the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
duke of Acquitaine, the count de Mortain,
the count de la Marche, Louis de Baviere, the
lord Gilles of Brittany, the count de St Pol, the
chancellor of France, with many other nobles
of high rank.</p>

<p>In consequence of this proclamation, many
of the captains and noblemen of the Armagnacs
grew cold in their service, or delayed joining
them according to their former agreements;
and fearing greater evils might befal them by
further incurring the indignation of the king,
they withdrew to the king’s party, and excused
themselves the best way they could.</p>

<p>While these affairs were going forward,
the duke of Burgundy remained at Pontoise,
as I have before said, and was there joined by
numbers of men at arms, as well vassals to the
king as his own.</p>

<p>During his stay at Pontoise, a man of a
strong make entered his apartment, with the
intention to murder him, and had a knife hid
in his sleeve to accomplish his wicked purpose;
but as he advanced to speak with him, the
duke, having no knowledge of his person, and
always suspicious of such attempts, placed a
bench before him. Shortly after, some of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
his attendants, perceiving his design, instantly
arrested him, when, on confessing his intentions,
he was beheaded in the town of Pontoise.</p>

<p>The king, in order to strike more terror
into the duke of Orleans and his allies, issued
other proclamations throughout his kingdom.
Underneath is the tenour of the one which he
sent to the bailiff of Amiens.</p>

<p>‘Charles, by the grace of God, king of
France, to the bailiff of Amiens, or to his
lieutenant, sends health.</p>

<p>‘It has lately come to our knowledge, by
informations laid before our council, that John,
our uncle of Berry, Charles our nephew, duke
of Orleans, and his brothers, with John de
Bourbon, John d’Alen&ccedil;on, Charles d’Albreth,
our cousin Bernard d’Armagnac, in conjunction
with others, their aiders and abettors, moved
by the wicked and damnable instigations of
their own minds, have for a long time plotted
to depose and deprive us of our royal authority,
and with their utmost power to destroy our
whole family, which God forbid! and to place
another king on the throne of France, which is
most abominable to the hearing of every heart
in the breasts of our loyal subjects.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>‘We, therefore, by the mature deliberation
of our council, do most solemnly, in this public
manner, divulge these abominable and traitorous
intentions of the aforesaid persons, and earnestly
do call for the assistance of all our loyal subjects,
as well those bound to serve us by the tenure of
their fiefs as the inhabitants of all our towns,
who have been accustomed to bear arms, to
guard and defend our rights and lives against
the traitors aforesaid, who have now too nearly
approached our person, inasmuch as they have
entered by force our town of St Denis, which
contains not only many holy relics of the saints
but the sacred bodies of saints, our crown and
royal standard, known by the name of the
Oriflamme, with several other precious and
rare jewels.</p>

<p>‘They have also gained forcible possession
of the bridge of St Cloud, and have invaded our
rights, (not to say any thing of our very dear
and well-beloved cousin, the duke of Burgundy,
to whom they have sent letters of defiance,) by
setting fire to and despoiling our towns and
villages, robbing churches, ransoming or
killing our people, forcing married women,
and ravishing maidens, and committing every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
mischief which the bitterest enemy could do.
We therefore do enjoin and command thee,
under pain of incurring our heaviest displeasure,
that thou instantly cause this present ordinance
to be proclaimed in the usual places in the town
of Amiens, and in different parts within thy
said bailiwick, so that no one may plead
ignorance; and that thou do punish corporally,
and by confiscation of property, the aforesaid
persons, their allies and confederates, whom
thou mayest lay hands on, as guilty of the
highest treason against our person and crown,
that by so doing an example may be held forth
to all others. We also command, under the
penalty aforesaid, all our vassals, and all those
in general who are accustomed to carry arms,
to repair to us as soon as possible. Be careful
to have the within ordinances strictly executed,
so that we may not have cause to be displeased
with thee.</p>

<p>‘Given at Paris, the 14th day of October,
1411, and in the 32d year of our reign.’</p>

<p>This ordinance was signed by the king, on
the report of his council, and thus dispatched
to Amiens and other good towns, where it was
proclaimed in the usual places, and with such
effect on the vassals and loyal subjects of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
king that they hastened in prodigious numbers
to serve him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, very many of those
who were of the Orleans-party were arrested
in divers parts of the realm,&mdash;some of whom
were executed, and others confined in prison, or
ransomed, as if they had been public enemies.
It was pitiful to hear the many and grievous
complaints which were made by the people
of their sufferings, more especially by those in
the neighbourhood of Paris and in the isle of
France.</p>

<p>I must not forget, among other
circumstances, to relate, that the Parisians,
to the amount of three thousand, as well
those of the garrison as others, sallied out of
Paris, and went to the palace of Winchester
(Bic&ecirc;tre), a very handsome mansion of the
duke of Berry, where, from hatred to the
duke, they destroyed and plundered the
whole, leaving the walls only standing.&mdash;When
they had done this, they went and
destroyed another house, where the duke
kept his horses, situated on the river Seine,
not far from the h&ocirc;tel de Neelle.</p>

<p>The duke was much enraged when he
was told of the insult and mischief that had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
been done to him, and said aloud, that a time
would come when these Parisians should pay
dearly for it.</p>

<p>Affairs daily grew worse; and at length,
the duke of Berry, the duke of Orleans and
his brothers, the duke of Bourbon, the counts
d’Alen&ccedil;on and d’Armagnac, the lord d’Albreth,
were personally banished the realm by the king,
with all their adherents, of whatever rank they
might be, by sound of trumpet in all the squares
of Paris, and forbidden to remain or set foot
within it until they should be recalled.</p>

<p>They were not only banished the kingdom
of France, but, by virtue of a bull of pope
Urban V. of happy memory, (preserved in the
Tr&eacute;sor des Chartres of the king’s privileges in
the holy chapel at Paris), they were publicly
excommunicated and anathematised in all the
churches of the city of Paris, by bell, book,
and candle. Many of their party were much
troubled at these sentences, but, nevertheless,
continued the same conduct, and made a more
bitter war than before.

<p class="hang">THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY MARCHES A LARGE
ARMY FROM PONTOISE TO PARIS, THROUGH
MELUN.&mdash;THE SITUATION AND CONDUCT OF
THE DUKE OF ORLEANS.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I have</span> mentioned, that during the stay of
the duke of Burgundy at Pontoise, he received
great reinforcements of men at arms from all
parts: among others, the count de Penthievre,
his son-in-law, joined him with a noble
company. Having remained there for about
fifteen days, and made diligent inquiry into
the state of his adversaries, on the 22d day of
October, he marched his whole army thence
about two o’clock in the afternoon. As the
royal road from that place to Paris was
occupied by the enemy, he quitted it for
that through Melun sur Seine, where he
crossed the river with full fifteen thousand
horse, and, marching all night, arrived on the
morrow morning at the gate of St Jacques at
Paris. Great multitudes went out of the town
to meet him; among whom were the butchers
of Paris, well armed and arrayed, conducted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
by the provosts of the Ch&acirc;telet and of the
merchants, under the command of the count
de Nevers, brother to the duke of Burgundy,
who was attended by several princes, noble
lords and captains: even the great council of
state went out upwards of a league to meet
him, and to do him honour. Indeed, they all
showed him as much deference and respect as
they could have done to the king of France,
on his return from a long journey.</p>

<p>With regard to the people of Paris, they
made great rejoicings on his arrival, and sang
carols in all the streets through which he
passed; and because his entry was made late
in the day, and it was dusk, the streets were
illuminated with great quantities of torches,
bonfires and lanthorns.</p>

<p>On his approach to the Louvre, the duke
of Acquitaine, who had married his daughter,
advanced to meet him, and received him with
joy and respect. He led him into the Louvre,
and presented him to the king and queen, who
received him most graciously.</p>

<p>Having paid his due respects, he withdrew,
and went to lodge at the h&ocirc;tel de Bourbon.
The earl of Arundel was quartered, with
his attendants, at the priory of St Martin des
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Champs, and his Englishmen near to him
in the adjoining houses. The rest quartered
themselves as well as they could in the city.</p>

<p>On the morrow, which was a Sunday,
Enguerrand de Bournouville, with many
valiant men at arms and archers, as well
Picards as English, made a sally as far as La
Chapelle, which the Armagnacs had fortified,
and quartered themselves within it. On seeing
their adversaries advancing, they mounted their
horses, and a sharp skirmish ensued, in which
many were unhorsed. Among those who
behaved well, sir Enguerrand was pre-eminent.
Near his side was John of Luxembourg, nephew
to the count de St Pol, but very young. Many
were wounded, but few killed. The English,
with their bows and arrows, were very active in
this affair.</p>

<p>While this action was fought, the Armagnacs
quartered at St Denis, Montmartre, and other
villages, hearing the bustle, mounted their horses,
and hastened to cut off the retreat of Enguerrand.
He was informed of this in time, and, collecting
his men, retreated toward Paris; but as the
enemy were superior in numbers, they pressed
hard on his rear, and killed and made prisoners
several of his men.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>The duke of Orleans and the princes of
his party, on hearing of the arrival of the duke
of Burgundy with so large an army in Paris,
ordered their men at arms, and others that
were lodged in the villages round, to unite and
quarter themselves at St Denis. To provide
forage, sir Clugnet de Brabant was sent with
a body of men at arms into the Valois and
Soissonois, where there was abundance. Sir
Clugnet acquitted himself well of his command,
and brought a sufficient quantity to St Denis;
for at this time there was great plenty of corn
and other provision in France.</p>

<p>The Armagnacs were, therefore, well
supplied; and as they were the strongest on
that side of Paris, they daily made excursions
of different parties as far as the rivers Marne
and Oise, and throughout the isle of France.
In like manner, the army of the king and the
duke of Burgundy scoured the country on the
other side of the Seine, as far as Montlehery,
Meulan and Corbeil; and thus was the noble
kingdom of France torn to pieces.</p>

<p>There were frequent and severe rencounters
between the men at arms of each side; and a
continued skirmish was going forward between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
those in Paris and in St Denis, when the honour
of the day was alternately won.</p>

<p>Among other places where these skirmishes
took place was a mill, situated on an eminence,
and of some strength. In this mill, two or
three hundred of the Orleans-party sometimes
posted themselves, when the Parisians and
Burgundians made an attack on them, which
lasted even until night forced them to retreat.&mdash;At
other times, the Burgundians posted
themselves in the mill, to wait for the assault
of their adversaries.</p>

<p>The duke of Orleans had with him an
english knight, called the lord de Clifford, who
had, some time before, joined him with one
hundred men at arms and two hundred archers,
from the country of the Bourdelois. Having
heard that the king of England had sent the
earl of Arundel, with several other lords, to
the duke of Burgundy, he waited on the duke
of Orleans to request that he would permit
him to depart, for that he was afraid his
sovereign would be displeased with him should
he remain any longer. The duke of Orleans
having for a while considered his request
granted it, but on condition that neither he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
himself nor his men should bear arms against
him during the war. The knight made him
this promise, and then returned to England.</p>

<p>On the 6th day of November, Troullart
de Moncaurel, governor and bailiff of Senlis,
having marched about six score combatants of
his garrison to the country of Valois, was met
by seven score of the Armagnacs, who vigorously
attacked him; but, after many gallant deeds were
done, Troullart remained victorious. From
sixty to eighty of the Armagnacs were taken
or slain; and among the prisoners was sir
William de Saveuse, who had followed the
Orleans-party, when his two brothers, Hector
and Philip, were in arms with the duke of
Burgundy. Thus, in this abominable warfare,
were brothers engaged against brothers, and sons
against fathers. After this defeat, Troullart
de Moncaurel and Peter Quieriet, who had
accompanied him, returned with their booty
to Senlis, when, shortly after, by the exertions
of the old lord de Saveuse and the two brothers,
Hector and Philip, sir William obtained his
liberty.

<p class="hang">THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY LEADS A GREAT
FORCE, WITH THE PARISIANS, TO ST CLOUD,
AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duke of Burgundy having remained
some time at Paris with his army, and having
held many councils with the princes and captains
who were there, marched out of the town
about midnight, on the 9th of November, by
the gate of St Jacques. He was magnificently
accompanied by men at arms and Parisians,
among whom were the counts de Nevers, de
la Marche, de Vaudemont, de Penthievre, de
St Pol, the earl of Arundel, Boucicaut marshal
of France, the lord de Vergy marshal of
Burgundy, the lord de Heilly, lately appointed
marshal of Acquitaine, the lord de St George,
sir John de Croy, Enguerrand de Bournouville,
the lord de Fosseux, sir Regnier Pot governor
of Dauphiny, the seneschal of Hainault sir
John de Guistelle, the lord de Brimeu, the
earl of Kent, an Englishman, with many other
nobles, as well from Burgundy as from Picardy
and different countries. They were estimated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
by good judges at six thousand combatants, all
accustomed to war, and four thousand infantry
from the town of Paris.</p>

<p>When they had passed the suburbs, they
advanced in good array, under the direction of
trusty guides, to within half a league of Saint
Cloud, where the Armagnacs were quartered.
It might be about eight o’clock in the morning
when they came thither, and the weather was
very cold and frosty. Being thus arrived
without the enemy knowing of it, the duke of
Burgundy sent the marshal of Burgundy, sir
Gaultier des Ruppes, sir Guy de la Trimouille,
and le veau de Bar, with eight hundred men
at arms, and four hundred archers, across the
Seine, toward St Denis, to prevent the enemy
from there crossing the river by a new bridge
which they had erected over it. These lords
so well executed the above orders that they
broke down part of the bridge, and defended
the passage.</p>

<p>The duke, in the mean time, ascended the
hill of St Cloud in order of battle, and at the
spot where four roads met posted the seneschal
of Hainault, sir John de Guistelle, the lord
de Brimeu, John Phillips and John Potter<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
english captains, at one of them, with about
four hundred knights and esquires, and as many
archers. At another road, he stationed the
lords de Heilly and de Ront, Enguerrand de
Bournouville, and Aym&eacute; de Vitry, with as
many men as the knights above-mentioned.
The third road was guarded by Neville earl of
Kent<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>, with some picard captains; and the
Parisians and others, to a great amount, were
ordered to Sevres, to defend that road.</p>

<p>When these four divisions had arrived at
their posts, they made together a general assault
on the town of St Cloud, which the Armagnacs
had fortified with ditches and barriers to the
utmost of their power. At these barriers, a
notable defence was made by those who had
heard of the arrival of the enemy, under the
command of their captains, namely, sir James
de Plachiel, governor of Angoul&ecirc;me, the lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
de Cambour, William Batillier, sir Mansart du
Bos, the bastard Jacob, knight, and three other
knights from Gascony, who fought bravely for
some time; but the superiority of numbers,
who attacked them vigorously on all sides,
forced them to retreat from their outworks,
when they were pursued, fighting, however, as
they retreated, to the tower of the bridge and
the church, which had been fortified.</p>

<p>The whole of the burgundian force which
had been ordered on this duty, excepting the
party who guarded the passage of the bridge,
now bent all their efforts against the church.
The attack was there renewed with greater
vigour than before, and, notwithstanding the
gallant defence that was made, the church was
stormed, and many were slain in the church as
well as at the barriers. Numbers also were
drowned of the crowd that was pressing to
re-enter the tower of the bridge, by the
drawbridge breaking under their weight.</p>

<p>It was judged by those well acquainted
with the loss of the Armagnacs, that including
the drowned, there were nine hundred killed
and five hundred prisoners. Among these last
were sir Mansart du Bos, the lord de Cambour,
and William Batillier. In the town of St Cloud
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
were found from twelve to sixteen hundred
horses that had been gained by plunder, and
a variety of other things.</p>

<p>While this was passing, the duke of
Burgundy was with the main army drawn
up in battle-array, on a plain above the town:
he had with him the greater part of the princes,
and his spies were every where on the look-out
that the enemy might not surprise him by any
unexpected attack.</p>

<p>The engagement at the tower of the bridge
was still continued by the Burgundians, in the
hope of taking it; but it was labour in vain,
for those within defended it manfully.</p>

<p>Some of the garrison sallied out on the
opposite side, and hastened to St Denis, to
inform the duke of Orleans of the disaster
that had befallen them. He was sorely
displeased thereat, and instantly mounted his
horse, accompanied by the duke of Bourbon,
the counts d’Alen&ccedil;on and d’Armagnac, the
constable, the master of the cross-bows, the
young Boucicaut, and about two thousand
combatants, advanced toward St Cloud, and
drew up in battle-array on the side of the
river Seine, opposite to where the duke of
Burgundy was posted, and made every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
preparation as if for an immediate combat.
The duke of Burgundy and his men likewise
dismounted, drew up in order of battle, and
displayed his banner, which was most rich
and splendid. But notwithstanding the eager
desire which these princes showed for the
combat, it was to no purpose,&mdash;for the river
was between them, so that no damage could
accrue to either party, excepting by some
chance bolts from the cross-bows, who shot
at random.</p>

<p>When the Armagnacs had remained there
for some time, seeing that nothing effectual
could be done, they remounted their horses
and returned to St Denis, leaving, however, a
reinforcement to defend the tower of St Cloud.
On their departure, the duke of Burgundy held
a council, and it was determined to march the
whole army back to Paris. The duke lost this
day, in slain, not more than from sixteen to
twenty; but there were many wounded, among
whom were Enguerrand de Bournouville and
Aym&eacute; de Vitry, who had fought well, as did
the lord of Heilly. In like manner, the earl
of Arundel and his men behaved gallantly;
and it was one of them who had made sir
Mansart du Bos prisoner, but for a sum of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
money he resigned him to one of the king’s
officers.</p>

<p>The duke of Burgundy, on his return,
was received by the Parisians with great
acclamations; for they had heard of his
brilliant success, and they imagined that
through his means they should shortly be
delivered from their enemies, who oppressed
them sorely. With regard to the king, the
duke of Acquitaine, and the members of the
grand council, prelates as well as seculars, the
reception which they gave him, the princes
and the captains of his army, is not to be
described.</p>

<p>The duke of Orleans, learning that the
duke of Burgundy had returned to Paris with
his army, held a council with the heads of his
party, when, having considered the severe loss
they had suffered of the most expert of their
captains, and the great power and numbers of
their opponents, whom they could not at this
moment withstand with hopes of success, they
resolved to retire to their own countries, and
collect a sufficient army to oppose any force
the king and the duke of Burgundy should
bring against them. This was no sooner
determined than executed; for they instantly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
packed up their baggage, and, crossing the
newly-erected bridge over the Seine, which
they had repaired, and the bridge of St Cloud,
hastily marched all night toward Estampes,
and then continued their route to Orleans,
and to other towns and castles under their
obedience.</p>

<p>Thus, therefore, the duke of Orleans, in
seeking vengeance for the death of his father,
gained only disgrace and great loss of men.
Such of them as were slain in the field, at the
battle of St Cloud, were there inhumanly left
without sepulture, as being excommunicated,
a prey to dogs, birds, and wild beasts. Some
lords of his party, such as sir Clugnet de
Brabant, sir Aym&eacute; de Sarrebruche, the lord
de Hufalize, and many more, passed through
the county of Valois to Champagne, and
thence to their own homes.</p>

<p>News of this retreat was, very early on the
morrow, carried to the duke of Burgundy and
his captains at Paris. Some of them mounted
their horses, and went to St Denis, when all
that the Armagnacs had left was seized on and
pillaged: they even arrested and carried away,
in the king’s name, the abbot of St Denis, for
having admitted his enemies into that town.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
Many of the principal inhabitants were also
fined, notwithstanding the excuses they offered.
Others of the duke’s officers went to the town
of St Cloud, which they found abandoned.&mdash;Many
pursued the Armagnacs, but in vain;
for they had marched all night, and were at a
considerable distance before the news of their
decampment had reached Paris.</p>

<p>A few days after, the king, by the advice
and entreaties of the duke of Burgundy, bought
the greater part of the prisoners made at the
late battle, by paying their ransoms to those
who had taken them. In the number was
Colinet, thus surnamed by many, who had
betrayed the bridge of St Cloud to the duke
of Orleans; and on the 12th day of November,
he and five of his accomplices were beheaded
in the market-place at Paris: his body was
quartered, and the five others were hung up
by the arms on the gibbet at Montfaucon.</p>

<p>On the 13th of the same month, a sermon
was preached in the church-square, before the
porch of N&ocirc;tre Dame in Paris, by a Friar Minor,
in the presence of the duke of Burgundy, many
princes, and a great concourse of people,&mdash;in
which he said that the bulls given by pope
Urban V. had been of the utmost efficacy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
against the rebellious subjects of the king, and
publicly denounced the duke of Orleans and
his party as excommunicated. They were
also thus denounced in many other succeeding
sermons.</p>

<p>The ensuing day, the king heard mass in
N&ocirc;tre Dame, and returned to the Louvre to
dinner, when he most graciously received the
earl of Arundel, and caused him to be seated at
his table next to the duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Many councils were held at Paris respecting
this war, and on the measures the king should
now adopt. It was at length determined, that
on account of the winter, neither the king nor
the princes should attempt any thing more
until the ensuing summer, but only have
some able captains with a sufficient force on
the frontiers, to harrass and pursue the enemy,
and keep him in check. In consequence, the
lord Boucicaut marshal of France, the lord
de Heilly marshal of Acquitaine, Enguerrand
de Bournouville, Aym&eacute; de Vitry, the lord de
Miraumont and others, were ordered on this
service with a very considerable force. They
marched toward Estampes and Bonneval,
and those parts, having with them the lord
de Ront.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>Bonneval, on the first summons from
the above captains, surrendered to the king’s
obedience, and the greater part of them were
lodged in the town, and in an adjoining abbey of
some strength. Those of Estampes refused to
surrender, for it was garrisoned by the duke of
Berry, and began to make war on the troops
of the king and the duke of Burgundy, by
the instigation of the lord Louis de Bourbon,
governor of Dourdan, who resided there.</p>

<p>At this period, with the consent of the
duke of Burgundy, sir John de Croy, eldest son
to the lord de Croy, still detained prisoner by
the duke of Orleans, marched from Paris,
with eight hundred combatants, for the castle
of Monchas, in the county of Eu, in which
were the duke of Bourbon’s children and his
lady-duchess, namely, one son about three years
old, and a daughter by her first husband nine
years old, with their nurses and other attendants.
The son of sir Mansart du Bos, and the lord
de Foulleuses, knight, were also there. The
castle and the whole of its inhabitants were
taken by sir John de Croy; and he carried
them, and all he found within it, to the castle
of Renty, where he held them prisoners, until
his father, the lord de Croy, was released.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
When this misfortune was told to the duke of
Bourbon, he was much afflicted; but the
duchess took it so sensibly to heart that very
soon after she died of grief<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>.</p>

<p class="hang">THE KING OF FRANCE SENDS THE COUNT DE
SAINT POL TO THE VALOIS, AND TO COUCY,
AND OTHER CAPTAINS TO DIFFERENT PARTS
AGAINST THE ARMAGNACS.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Conformable</span> to the resolutions of the
aforesaid council, count Waleran de St Pol
was sent into the Valois, to reduce the whole
of that country to the king’s obedience, and
then to march to Coucy with a large body of
men at arms, archers, and cross-bows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>Sir Philip de Servolles, bailiff of Vitry en
Pertois, was also ordered into the country of
Vertus, with a considerable force, to subdue
the whole of it. The vidame of Amiens was
sent into the county of Clermont. Ferry
d’Hangest, bailiff of Amiens, was ordered,
for the above purpose, into the counties of
Boulogne, Eu, and Gamaches.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Crespy, the principal
town of the Valois, no sooner learnt the
intentions of the count de St Pol than they
surrendered it to him, and received him
handsomely. He thence advanced to the
castle of Pierrefons, which was very strong,
and well provided with all warlike stores and
provision. On coming before it, he held a
parley with the lord de Boquiaux the governor,
who concluded a treaty with him for its surrender,
on condition that the count would pay him, in
the king’s name, two thousand golden crowns
for his expenses, and that the garrison should
carry away all they had with them. The lady
of Gaucourt, who was in the castle, retired to
the castle of Coucy, where she was honourably
received by sir Robert d’Esne, the governor.</p>

<p>The count de St Pol marched from
Pierrefons to la Fert&eacute;-Milon, a very strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
castle, and to Villers-Cotter&ecirc;ts, both belonging
to the duke of Orleans; when not only these
two but all the other places in Valois, hearing of
the surrender of so strong a castle as Pierrefons
without making any resistance, surrendered, and
returned to their obedience to the king. The
Count placed good garrisons in each, and then
marched for Coucy, in the Soissonois, where,
as I have before said, sir Robert d’Esne was
governor of the castle. He had with him
Rigault des Fontaines, and others attached
to the party of the duke of Orleans. The
governor of the town of Coucy was sir
Enguerrand des Fontaines, and within it were
many noblemen, who, holding a council,
resolved to surrender the place, and to leave it
with all their baggage.</p>

<p>The count quartered himself and his men
at arms in the town and suburbs, and then
summoned sir Robert d’Esne, in the king’s
name, to surrender the castle. This sir Robert
refused to do, saying, that the duke of Orleans
had given him orders, when he appointed him
governor, never to surrender it without his
consent or knowledge, and these orders he had
sworn to obey; that it was well provided with
all kinds of stores, and plenty of provision, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
that he did not fear its being taken by force;
and he hoped, that before he should be induced
to yield it, means would be found to restore his
lord and master to the good graces of the king.&mdash;&mdash;The
count, on hearing this answer, ordered
the castle to be surrounded, and quartered his
men as near to it as possible, keeping up at
the same time a brisk cannonade. Among
other expedients, the count employed a body
of miners, to undermine the gate of the lower
court, called la Porte Maistre Odon, which
was as handsome an edifice as could be seen
for twenty leagues round; and he employed
companies of miners to work at the other large
towers, who were so successful that, in a short
time, the mines were ready to be set fire to.</p>

<p>The governor was again summoned to
surrender, but again refused. Upon which,
the count ordered his men under arms, to be
prepared for the storm should it be necessary;
and when all was ready, fire was set to the
combustibles within the mines, so that when
the supporters were burnt, the whole of the
tower and gate fell flat down, but, fortunately
for the besieged, the inside wall remained
entire, so that the besiegers were not greatly
benefited. Several were killed and wounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
on both sides by the fall of the towers: one of
them at the corner was prevented from falling
to the ground by the wall supporting it; and
one of the men at arms remained on this
inclined tower, where he had been posted to
guard it, and was in great peril of his life, but
was saved by the exertions of the garrison.</p>

<p>At length, when the count de St Pol had
been before this castle of Coucy about three
months, a treaty was entered into between him
and sir Robert, that he would surrender the
castle on condition that he and his garrison
should depart unmolested whither they pleased,
with all they could carry with them, and
should receive, for their expenses, twelve
hundred crowns, or thereabout. When this
was concluded, the governor marched off
with about fifty combatants, the principal of
whom were his son, le Baudrain de Fur, knight,
Rigault des Fontaines, before mentioned, and
Gaucher de Baissu. The lady de Gaucourt
departed also in their company. Sir Robert
and the greater part of his men went and
fixed their residence at Creve-coeur and in the
castle of Cambresis.</p>

<p>The count de St Pol, on the surrender of
the castle, appointed sir Gerard de Herbannes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
governor, with a sufficient garrison. There
were with him on this expedition his nephew
John of Luxembourg, the vidame of Amiens,
the lord de Houcourt, and many other nobles
and esquires from Picardy, especially such as
were his vassals. Having finished this business
so successfully, he returned to the king at Paris,
who, in consideration of his good qualities, and
as a remuneration for his services, nominated
him constable of France. The sword of office
was delivered to him, and he took the usual
oaths, in the room of the lord d’Albreth, who
had been dismissed therefrom, being judged
unworthy to hold it any longer.</p>

<p>In like manner, the lord de Rambures
was appointed master of the cross-bows of
France, in the place of the lord de Hangest,
who had been dismissed by the king. The
lord de Longny, a native of Brittany, was
made marshal of France, on the resignation,
and with the consent, of the lord de Rieux<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>,
who was superannuated.

<p class="hang">SIR PHILIP DE SERVOLLES, BAILIFF OF VITRY,
LAYS SIEGE TO THE CASTLE OF MOYENNES.&mdash;&mdash;OTHER
PLACES ARE BY THE KING’S
OFFICERS REDUCED TO HIS OBEDIENCE.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> regard to the county of Vertus, the moment
sir Philip de Servolles came before the town of
that name, it surrendered to the king,&mdash;and in
like manner all the other places in that county,
excepting the castle of Moyennes. In this castle
were sir Clugnet de Brabant, his brother John
of Brabant, sir Thomas de Lorsies, and many
more, who would not on any account submit
to the king.</p>

<p>The bailiff of Vitry consequently laid siege
to it, and made every preparation to conquer it
by force. It was, however, in vain; for the
garrison were well provided with provision,
artillery and stores of all kinds, so that they
little feared the besiegers, and very frequently
cut off their detachments.</p>

<p>The siege lasted for upwards of three
months; and at the end of this time, sir
Clugnet and sir Thomas de Lorsies, mounted
on strong and active coursers, followed by two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
pages, set out from the castle,&mdash;and, galloping
through the besieging army with their lances
in their rests, passed safely, striking down all
opposers, escaped to Luxembourg, and went
to sir Aym&eacute; de Sarrebruche to seek for succour.
But they did not return with any assistance;
for a few days after, John of Brabant was made
prisoner in a sally from the castle, and, by order
of the king and council, beheaded in the town
of Vitry. After this event, the remainder of the
garrison surrendered themselves to the king’s
obedience, on stipulating with the bailiff that
they were to have their lives and fortunes spared.
He instantly new-garrisoned the castle.</p>

<p>Thus was that whole country reduced to
the king’s obedience; and that of Clermont
followed the example, by surrendering to the
vidame of Amiens without making any
resistance. The garrisons in the different
towns and castles that had done great mischief
to the surrounding country withdrew with all
their baggage, under the protection of passports,
to the Bourbonois, and were replaced by the
king’s troops.</p>

<p>The bailiff of Amiens was equally
successful at Boulogne-sur-mer, which, with
all the adjacent places, surrendered, excepting
the castle of Boulogne,&mdash;the seneschal of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
which, by name sir Louis de Corail, a native
of Auvergne, would not yield it without the
permission of his lord, the duke of Berry,
who had intrusted it to his guard. The
bailiff, however, with his men, destroyed the
drawbridge, and filled up the ditches, so that
no one could enter or come out of the castle.
A parley took place between the governor and
bailiff, when the first was allowed to send to
his lord, the duke of Berry, to know if he
would consent that the castle should be given
up to the king, and hold him discharged for
so doing.</p>

<p>The duke, in answer, bade him surrender
the castle to the king’s officers, and come to
him at Bourges, which was done. In like
manner, all the places in the county of Eu,
and in the territory of Gamaches, were
surrendered to the king; and the officers
who had been placed in them by their lords
were dismissed, and others of the king’s
servants put in their room.</p>

<p>During this time, very large sums of
money were raised in Paris and elsewhere, to
pay the english troops who had come to serve
the duke of Burgundy by permission of the
king of England. On receiving their payment,
the earl of Arundel, with his men, returned to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
England by way of Calais; but the earl of
Kent<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and his troops remained in the service
of the duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p>At this moment, the Orleans-party were
in great distress, and knew not where to save
themselves; for the instant any of them were
discovered, whether secular or ecclesiastic,
they were arrested and imprisoned, and some
executed,&mdash;others heavily fined. Two monks
were arrested at this time, namely, master Peter
Fresnel, bishop of Noyon, who was taken by
sir Anthony de Craon, and carried from Noyon
to the castle of Crotoy; the other, the abbot of
Foresmoustier, was made prisoner by the lord
de Dampierre, admiral of France. They were
soon delivered on paying a large ransom,
when each returned to his bishoprick and
monastery.</p>

<p>The lord de Hangest, still calling himself
grand master of the french cross-bows, being
attached to the Orleans-party, had, after the
retreat from St Denis, secretly retired to the
castle of Soissons. Having a desire to attempt
regaining the king’s favour, he sent a poursuivant
to demand a safe conduct from Troullart de
Moncaurel, bailiff and governor of Senlis, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
him to come and reside in that town. The
safe conduct was sent to him, and he came to
Senlis; but, because there was no mention of
his return in this permission, Troullart made
him and fifteen other gentlemen prisoners in
the king’s name. Shortly after, they were
carried to the Ch&acirc;telet in Paris, to his great
displeasure, but he could not prevent it.</p>

<p>The count de Roussy also had retired,
after the retreat from St Denis, to his castle of
Pont &aacute; Arsy sur Aine; but it was instantly
surrounded by the peasants of the Laonnois,
who increased to about fifteen hundred, and
made most terrible assaults on the castle,&mdash;and,
in spite of its deep moat and thick walls, they
damaged it very much. These peasants called
themselves the king’s children. Sir Brun de
Barins, knight, bailiff of the Vermandois, and
the provost of Laon, came to assist and to
command them,&mdash;when the count, perceiving
the danger he was in, to avoid falling into the
hands of these peasants, surrendered himself
and his castle to the bailiff of the Vermandois,
on condition that his own life, and the lives of
all within it, should be spared. The bailiff
accepted the terms, and, having re-garrisoned
it with the king’s troops, carried the count and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
his men prisoners to Laon, where they remained
a long time; but at length, on paying a heavy
ransom, they obtained their liberty.</p>

<p>The archdeacon of Brie was, in like
manner, taken in the tower of Andely by
these peasants. He was natural son to the
king of Armenia. Sir William de Coussy,
who was of the Orleans-party, retired to his
brother in Lorraine, who was bishop of Metz.</p>

<p class="hang">THE DUKES OF ACQUITAINE AND BURGUNDY
MARCH TO  CONQUER ESTAMPES AND
DOURDAN.&mdash;&mdash;THE EXECUTION OF SIR
MANSART DU BOS AND OTHER PRISONERS.</p>


<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">During</span> these tribulations, there were so many
grievous complaints made to the king and the
princes at Paris, of the mischiefs done to the
country by the garrisons of Estampes and
Dourdan, that notwithstanding it had been
determined in council that neither the king
nor the duke of Acquitaine should take the
field until the winter should be passed, this
resolution was overruled by circumstances.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

<p>On the 23d day of November, the duke
of Acquitaine, accompanied by the duke of
Burgundy, the counts of Nevers, de la Marche,
de Penthievre, de Vaudemont, and the marshal
de Boucicaut, with others of rank, and a great
multitude of the Parisians on foot, marched
out of Paris, with the intent to reduce to the
king’s obedience the garrisons of Estampes and
Dourdan, and some others, who continued the
war on the part of the duke of Orleans and his
adherents.</p>

<p>He halted at Corbeil to wait for the whole
of his forces,&mdash;and thence, with an immense
quantity of warlike stores and bombards, with
other artillery, marched his army toward
Estampes, wherein was sir Louis de Bourdon,
who instantly withdrew into the castle. The
townsmen immediately returned to their former
obedience, and were kindly received by the duke
of Acquitaine, in consideration of his uncle the
duke of Berry. Sir Louis de Bourdon, however,
refused to surrender, although he was summoned
many times, when the castle was besieged on all
sides. The lord de Ront was at this time
prisoner there,&mdash;for he had been taken by sir
Louis not long before the arrival of the duke
of Acquitaine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>Many engines were now pointed against
the walls, which they damaged in several
places; and in addition, miners were employed
to underwork the towers. The siege was
carried on with such vigour that the garrison,
thinking it probable they should be taken by
storm, opened a parley, and, by means of the
lord de Ront, surrendered themselves to the
duke of Acquitaine. Sir Louis de Bourdon,
with some other gentlemen, his confederates,
were sent to the Ch&acirc;telet at Paris. Great part
of the wealth of Bourdon, with a most excellent
courser of his, were given to the lord de Ront,
to make amends for the losses which he sustained
when he was made prisoner.</p>

<p>The dukes of Acquitaine and Burgundy
re-garrisoned this place, and then returned with
their army to Paris; for in truth, they could
not, from the severity of the winter, make any
further progress. A few days after, by order
of the duke of Burgundy, many noble prisoners
were carried from Paris to the castle of Lille;
among whom were the lord de Hangest, sir
Louis de Bourdon, the lords de Gerennes, des
Fontaines, sir John d’Amboise and others, who
had been arrested for supporting the party of
the duke of Orleans. They suffered a long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
confinement, but were set at liberty on paying
a heavy fine.</p>

<p>At this period, sir Mansart du Bos was
beheaded in the market-place of Paris, his
body hung by the shoulders on the gibbet
at Montfaucon, and his head affixed to the
spike on the top of the market-house. This
execution took place at the instance of the
duke of Burgundy, because sir Mansart was
his liege man, nevertheless he had sent him his
challenge at the same time with the brothers of
Orleans, as has been before noticed. Not all
the solicitations of his friends could save him,
and he had many of weight with the duke, who
endeavoured earnestly to obtain his pardon; but
it was in vain, for the duke had resolved upon
his death.</p>

<p>There were in the prisons of the Ch&acirc;telet,
and in other prisons of Paris, very many of the
Orleans-party who perished miserably through
cold, famine, and neglect. When dead, they
were inhumanly dragged out of the town, and
thrown into the ditches a prey to dogs, birds,
and wild beasts. The reason of such cruel
conduct was their having been several times
denounced from the pulpits, and proclaimed
from the squares, as excommunicated persons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
It seemed, however, to many discreet men, as
well noble as of the church, that it was a great
scandal thus to treat those who were Christians
and acknowledged the laws of <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>.</p>

<p>The same rigorous conduct being persevered
in, a short time after, a valiant knight, called
sir Peter de Famechon, was beheaded in the
market-place of Paris: he was of the household
and family of the duke of Bourbon,&mdash;and his
head was affixed to a lance like the others.
The duke of Bourbon was much exasperated
at his death, especially when he was informed
of the disgraceful circumstances that had
attended it. At this time, therefore, all who
sided with the Armagnacs, and were taken,
ran great risk of their lives; for there were few
that dared speak in their favour, however near
their connexions might be.</p>

died in 1371. He was himself made a mareschal of France
in 1391, having been knighted, nine years before, at the battle
of Rosebec in Flanders. He went into Hungary and was
present at the battle of Nicopolis, and made prisoner with
John count of Nevers. He was again appointed to the
relief of the emperor of Constantinople in 1399. In 1401,
he was made governor of Genoa,&mdash;and he took the city
of Famagousta in Cyprus for the Genoese. He was made
prisoner at Agincourt, and died in England 1421. He was
a poet as well as warrior, and composed many rondeaux and

in 1386, on condition that he would become a Christian,
marry the daughter of the late king, and annex Lithuania to
Poland. This last condition, however, was not completely
fulfilled until the reign of Sigismond Augustus in 1569.

The author of ‘An Account of Livonia, with a
Relation of the Rise, Progress and Decay of the Marian
Teutonic Order,’ London, 1701, relates these transactions in
the manner following:</p>

<p>‘The order was now on the highest pinnacle of
prosperity and honour, exceeding great kings and potentates
of Europe in extent of dominions, power and riches, when
Ulricus &agrave; Jungingen was chosen great master; but he being
of a boisterous, fiery temper, soon broke the peace concluded
between Poland with his brother Conradus &agrave; Jungingen,
whereupon king Uladislaus Jagellon joining forces with his
father Witoldas of Lithuania, formed an army of 150,000
fighting men and marched into Prussia. To stop the
progress of this formidable army, the great master drew up
as many forces as he could, and, after the Livonians had
joined him, found his army consisted, in a general muster,
of 83,000 well armed stout combatants; and thus, with an
undaunted spirit, he marched forth to meet his enemy. Such
a battle as this was never heard of before in these parts, and
was given the 15th day of July 1410 in Prussia, near the
town Gilgenbourg, between the two villages Tannenberg
and Grunwald, on a large plain, with such obstinacy that,
according to an exact computation, there were actually killed,
on both sides, 100,000 on the spot. The Poles got the
victory, but lost 60,000 men. The order lost 40,000,&mdash;but
among them almost all their generals and commanders. The
great master himself, and the chief of the order, with 600
noble german marian knights, were there slain. There is still
kept every year a day of devotion upon that plain, in a chapel
built to the remembrance of this battle, marked with the date of
the year it happened, and this inscription, <i>Centum mille occisi</i>.
The king of Poland was so weakened by this dear-bought
victory that he very readily agreed to a peace. This memorable
battle is called The Battle of Tannenberg.’</p></div>

Moreri says, that the good duke Louis died at
Monbucan on the 19th of August 1410. By his wife Anne,
dauphiness of Auvergne and countess of Forez, he left John
count of Clermont, his son and successor: his other children,
Louis and two daughters, died without issue and unmarried.
He left also a natural son, named Hector, who was killed at
the siege of Soissons in 1414.</p></div>

I hardly know whether this can be the celebrated
archbishop of Rheims, and historian of the reign of Charles VI.
who was one of the most learned men of his time, and died
at an advanced age, in 1474. He had two brothers older
than himself, William des Ursins, baron of Treynel, chancellor
of France in 1445, and again in 1464,&mdash;and James Juvenal
des Ursins, who was archbishop of Rheims before him. The
history written by Juvenal des Ursins occupies the space from
1380 to 1422, and throws great light, by comparison, on
Froissart and Monstrelet.</p></div>

Q. De Nesle?</p>

<p>Guy III. de Nesle, lord of Offemont and Mello, was
grand master of the household to queen Isabella, and was
killed at Agincourt. His two sons, <i>John</i> III. and Guy IV.
followed him in succession. He had a third son, who died
with him at Agincourt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">68</a>
Monstrelet apparently mistakes. According to
Moreri, <i>Robert</i> duke of Bar died this year, leaving issue by
his wife Mary (daughter to John king of France),</p>

<p>1. Henry lord d’Ossy, who died in Hungary, 1396,
leaving by his wife Mary de Coucy, countess of Soissons, one
son, Robert count of Marle and Soissons, killed at Agincourt.</p>

<p>2. Philip, died in Hungary 1396.</p>

<p>3. Edward III. marquis du Pont, and duke of Bar
after his father’s death.</p>

<p>4. Louis cardinal of Bar.</p>

<p>5. Charles lord of Nogent.</p>

<p>6. John lord of Puisaye. (Both Edward and John
were killed at Agincourt.)</p>

<p>7. Yoland, queen of Arragon.</p>

<p>8. Mary, countess of Namur.</p>

<p>9. Bona, countess of St Pol.</p>

<p>One striking peculiarity is discernible in this table, viz.
the preference shown in the succession to Edward the third
son, over Robert, son of the eldest son of the deceased duke;
but this was according to the law of many feudal tenures,
which took no notice of our universally-established doctrine
of <i>representation</i> in descents. The same law prevailed in
Artois, and was the ground of that famous decision by which
Robert d’Artois was ejected in the middle of the fourteenth
century, and in consequence of which he retired in disgust to
the court of our Edward III. who asserted the justice of his
pretensions.</p></div>

The advice which, according to Stowe, king Henry
gave to the duke of Burgundy on this occasion was deserving
of more attention than he was disposed to pay to it. ‘The
duke of Burgoyne, desiring the king’s aid against the duke
of Orliance, promised many things,&mdash;amongst the which he
promised his daughter in marriage to the prince, and a great
sum of gold with her. To whom the king answered: ‘We
advertise you not to fight with your enemie in this case, who
justly seemeth to vexe you, for the death of his father by you
procured, but as much as in you lyeth endeavor yourself to
mitigate the young man’s wrath, and promise to make him
reasonable satisfaction, according to the advice of your friends;
and if then he will not cease from persecuting you, get you
into the strongest place of your dominion, and there gather
such power as may be able to put off his force. If then,
after this, he will make war against you, you shall have the
juster occasion to fight with him,&mdash;and in such case we will
shew you such favour as yee have demaunded.’ Thus there
were sent over to his ayde Thomas earl of Arundell, Gilbert
Umfreville earl of Angus, or earl of Kyme, sir Robert
Umfreville, sir John Oldcastle, lord Cobham, sir John Grey
and William Porter, with twelve hundred archers,’ &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">74</a>
According to the catalogue in Moreri, Arnauld de
Corbie, lord of Joigny, was at this time chancellor.</p></div>

Q. If this is not <i>Umfreville</i> earl of Angus and
<i>Kyme</i> (as Stowe calls him)? There was at this period no
Neville earl of Kent. The only earl of Kent of that family
was William Nevil lord Falconbridge, created 1461. I find
this conjecture somewhat confirmed by the original, which is,
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ousieville comte de Kam.</span>’ It is true, that Holinshed
mentions the earls of Pembroke and of <i>Kent</i> as being of the
expedition: but he cites Monstrelet as his authority, and is
therefore likely to be mistaken.</p></div>

secondly, of the constable d’Eu), lived till the year 1434,
when she died at Lyons. See Morery. Her children by the

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
